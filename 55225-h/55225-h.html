        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seems
        unnecessary to suggest that this book is entirely independent of the
        conventional lines of the modern realistic novel. To any who hold
        that idealism in fiction is not artistic, that a didactic element is
        inadmissible, and that philosophizing has no place, the work will
        hardly commend itself. To others, who believe that fiction may be a
        useful vehicle for the conveyance of helpful ideals, and even
        abstract truth, it is offered with the hope that it may furnish some
        measure both of entertainment and profit.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On many historical
        and chronological points that are involved, authorities differ; but
        so far as the author has been able to sift them, the prevailing and
        apparently most probable hypotheses have been followed. As may be
        inferred, it has been necessary to glean in many fields for the
        facts, opinions, and conclusions that make up the historic portion of
        the raw material from which this story has been fabricated.<a id=
        "noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id="Pgvi" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A majority of the
        characters being creations, and a large part of the action also
        unhistoric, it must be left to the judgment of the reader how well
        they fit into their historic frame-work. So far as St. Paul is
        introduced in the narrative, nearly everything delineated belongs to
        those portions of his life which are but very briefly or incidentally
        touched upon, either in the Scriptural writings or other history. But
        utilizing many undoubted realities, the aim has been to fill in the
        wide blanks with that which is in accord and in the line of the
        possible or probable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The author has
        intended to respect the hallowed associations which cluster about the
        name of the great Apostle. But Paul was a man with like passions as
        other men, and to be faithful, any outline of the forces that played
        through his great soul should be drawn naturally, and without that
        misleading glamor often imposed by far-away time and distance. Only
        by such a treatment can his life be brought near, and its practical
        lessons enforced. If to any the interpretation seem unduly broad,
        they may be assured that the author has no iconoclastic intent, but
        on the contrary, an aim which is wholly constructive, whereby
        everything wholesome and uplifting in human life may be encouraged
        and strengthened.</p>

          TARSUS</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In an ancient
          city, late in the afternoon of a warm day in early autumn, a little
          procession was winding its way through the narrow crowded streets.
          The calm, measured pace and solemn countenances of the group
          plainly indicated its character as a religious ceremonial. Slightly
          in the lead were two priests, of such official and dignified mien
          that they appeared as though they knew the God of Israel face to
          face. It was as if the little Hebrew band, in threading a great
          throng of Gentiles, were laden with the accumulated weight of all
          the traditions of the Chosen and Circumcised since the time of
          Abraham. The reverberation of every sandal, as it struck upon the
          well-worn pavement, proclaimed, as loudly as words, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We are separate.”</span> Even the flocks of pigeons
          that were in the air seemed to hover over the moving column, as if
          to lend the gleam of their white wings to its stately
          rhythm.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2">[pg
          2]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The priests wore
          tall turbans of cup-shaped form, and were clad in long robes having
          broad borders decorated with a deep fringe, and gathered about the
          body with an ornamented girdle. Broad phylacteries, square in form,
          were bound by thongs, one upon the forehead, and one upon the left
          arm, each containing inscribed passages from the Law. They also
          wore embroidered ephods covering the back and breast, held together
          on the shoulders by brooches of onyx stones richly set in gold, and
          fastened below by a black band garnished with jewels. Their hands
          were crossed upon the breast, and eyes turned toward heaven.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Following just
          behind the priests were men and women in costumes such as were
          usually worn in the synagogue, which indicated that they were
          returning from a sacred service. At intervals the low, monotonous
          tones of a religious chant, or some soft rendering of passages from
          the Mosaic ritual, might have been audible to those in the near
          vicinity. They formed an embodied fragment of that long line of the
          faithful, who forget not the patriarchs and the lawgivers, and
          whose eyes are always turned towards Jerusalem and the Temple.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the arms of
          one of the women was a young infant, and around this least
          personage there seemed to gather an interest which showed that
          whatever the nature of the service just concluded, the babe must
          have been the central figure. The fond glances of the women and
          evident attention of the men plainly revealed that thorough
          satisfaction which comes from holy duty well performed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The city of
          Tarsus was the place, and the time about the middle of the first
          decade of the Christian era. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page3">[pg 3]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>Tarsus was a great commercial metropolis. It
          was located in the midst of a broad, fertile plain which mainly
          made up the province of Eastern or Flat Cilicia, as distinguished
          from Rugged Cilicia which bordered it on the north and west. The
          prolific soil, central location, and peculiar physical
          configuration, all tended to give it great political importance.
          Leading from the great plain through the high barrier of mountains
          which sweep from the coast irregularly around it are two passes,
          one leading up to the interior of Asia Minor, and the other giving
          access to the valley of the Orontes. It was naturally the
          meeting-place, and on the highway of trading caravans and military
          expeditions. Through this richly historic country, Cyrus marched to
          depose his brother from the Persian throne. It was on this plain
          that Alexander gained his decisive victory over Darius. Here have
          since been encamped the great hosts of western crusaders, and
          indeed, from the early dawn of history, this plain was the theatre
          of great events and conflicts, which had much to do with the
          shaping of empires, and the progress of the world’s
          civilization.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cold and
          rapid river Cydnus, fed by the snows of the Taurus range of
          mountains, flows through this fertile country; and Tarsus, the
          capital of the whole province, which was <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“no mean city,”</span> was located upon its banks. Its
          coins reveal its importance during the period between Xerxes and
          Alexander, and also while under Roman sway, when it was dignified
          by the name of Metropolis. Strabo says that in all that relates to
          philosophy and general education it was more illustrious than
          Athens or Alexandria. In the main it had the character <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page4">[pg 4]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of a Greek city; and the Grecian
          language, literature, and philosophy were generally cultivated. But
          there were also many Romans, Hebrews, Persians, and Syrians, with a
          sprinkling of other tribes and peoples, such as characterized an
          Oriental metropolis. On its busy wharves were great piles of
          merchandise, surrounded by groups of merchants and traders in many
          costumes, and speaking a variety of dialects.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was one of
          the most important epochs of history; a time when colossal
          personalities and events were stamping their impress upon the
          destiny of races and nations. The shores of the Mediterranean
          formed the heart of the world’s civilization; and Roman militarism,
          legality, and control were permeating and compacting that great
          empire, east and west. The Greek and Hebrew were important but
          subordinate elements in the human conglomerate of that eventful
          period. Various and unlike races were commingling; their customs
          and even their religions were shading into each other, and their
          languages becoming considerably interchangeable. The Roman
          represented law, government, conquest, and dominion; the Greek the
          more subtile ideals of philosophy, art, and intellectuality; while
          the Hebrew, intense and tenacious, was unconsciously laying the
          foundation, through his religious zeal, for the coming spread of
          Judaism’s great outgrowth, rival, and successor, Christianity. His
          hard religiosity and punctilious ceremonialism were not perceptibly
          softened even by close contact with Grecian poetry and idealism.
          Even Roman jurisprudence on the one hand, and idolatry on the
          other, could not penetrate them. As a rule, the various
          tribu<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5">[pg 5]</span><a name=
          "Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>taries to the great
          current of human history in its evolutionary course gradually
          mingle, each adding something of its own hue to the common volume,
          but the Hebraistic economy was the rare exception. Its oil would
          not mix with the general water of other systems.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the
          particular time with which we are dealing, general peace prevailed.
          There was one of those alternations of calmness which intervene
          between the fierce storms of racial conflict and religious strife
          and persecution.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Jewish
          procession, small in numbers, but important in spirit and destiny,
          threaded its way through the winding thoroughfares, attracting but
          a passing glance from the cosmopolitans which made up the multiform
          currents of every-day life in Tarsus. At length it halted in front
          of a family residence in the better part of the Hebrew quarter,
          into which one of the priests with the father of the child entered,
          followed by the mother with her young son in her arms, while the
          others dispersed. The babe, Saulus Paulus, was forty days old, and,
          in conformity to the Jewish ritual, had been taken to the synagogue
          for the prescribed presentation service.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before leaving
          the household, the priest tenderly took the child in his arms to
          give him a final blessing. Raising his eyes toward heaven, he
          seemed to feel a spirit of prophetic inspiration. With his right
          hand upon the head of the child, he reverently presumed to lift the
          curtain which veils the future, fervently exclaiming,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Son of Abraham, scion of the tribe of Benjamin, and
          heir of Benoni! The living blood of the Covenant flows in thy
          veins! Thou shalt wax strong, and be <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page6">[pg 6]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class=

          Thou shalt be a tongue of the God of Jacob, and many shall tremble
          when thou speakest! Thou shalt be a defender of Israel, and bring
          judgment to the Gentiles! Thou shalt open thy mouth and utter
          mighty things that are hidden from the Greek and Roman! Thou shalt
          sorely vex the enemies of the Circumcision, and bring them to
          naught! With holy zeal shalt thou pursue them”</span>—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then his visage
          became fixed, and he was like one in a trance. A voice, not his
          own, seemed to use his lips. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          behold—judgment—defeat—darkness! <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The uncircumcised
          prevail!</span></span>”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Abdiel, the
          priest, trembled like an aspen, and upon coming to himself,
          declared that he had seen a disturbing vision.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ancient
          Judaism accepted no compromise, and bowed to no defeat. When
          surrounded, and even almost submerged, by prevailing idolatry,
          polytheism, and heathenism, like a bow temporarily bent, it at
          length sprang back, and regained its original integrity. It was a
          casting in rigid form of a conglomerate of truth and error,
          righteousness and pride. It loathed other creeds and philosophies,
          and its Deity was limited by a racial boundary. It was a political
          theocracy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Phariseeism,
          which was the leading element of Jewish religiosity, was a compound
          of spiritual pride, exclusiveness, and intolerance. Missionary
          effort among other nations was not thought of because they were not
          worth it. God was the God of Israel. The Chosen People felt that
          they had a monopoly of the divine favor, and they proposed to keep
          it. But the teaching of the ancient <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page7">[pg 7]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>seers and expounders of righteousness,
          originally good, had become incrusted with a superficial formalism,
          and all vitality had left it. Even the Mosaic Law and the later
          sublime poems and religious compositions, though constantly and
          formally recited, were loaded down with traditions, and had become
          a complex system of polished dry bones. Notwithstanding the
          discipline of previous dispersions and captivities, such was the
          spirit of the Chosen People during the earliest years of the
          Christian era.</p>

          CYDNUS</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The residence of
          Benoni was situated upon the more elevated plateau which embraced
          the northwestern portion of the Cilician metropolis. A little
          distance to the north was the Orontes Gate, through which a
          thoroughfare, paved with much-worn gray and white flags, led out to
          the fertile regions in the broad plain above. Through this portal
          surged a continuous stream of life, alternating in direction during
          the different hours of the day like the tides in an inlet from the
          sea. Here were donkeys, with panniers bursting with fruits,
          lentils, onions, and beans, and awkward camels, raw-boned, rough,
          and gray, with great saddles hung over their backs, the capacious
          folds of which contained seemingly endless resources of baskets,
          boxes, and miscellaneous merchandise. Horses, roughly harnessed to
          light wagons which were heaped with dates, figs, grapes, and
          pomegranates, and at intervals small flocks of sheep, calves, and
          other animals for the food-supply of a great city, added to the
          picturesque conglomerate of life and bustle. Here entered blatant
          sellers of ducks, doves, and pigeons, mingling their shrill cries
          with the general din and confusion. The massive arched gateway
          formed the framework for a shifting panorama of races, tribes,
          costumes, and dia<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page9">[pg
          9]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>lects. Interspersed in the throng were red and
          blue cloaks more or less dingy, white turbans, faded tunics, long
          beards, and bare legs. Oriental display and decoration were seen in
          golden ornaments, including necklaces, bracelets, and pendants, all
          lending a gleam and sparkle to the motley streams of humanity. Here
          and there were women of the common classes, wearing loosely
          gathered long frocks, and upon their heads veils or wimples ample
          enough to fall in graceful folds about the shoulders. Some were
          leading brown-bodied and half-naked children, with hair and
          features indexing the blood of Greek, Jew, Cilician, or barbarian
          in picturesque contrast.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Three broad
          streets converged at the Orontes Gate; and these were lined with
          small shops containing merchandise, fruits, skins filled with wines
          and other strong drinks, jewelry, garments, articles for personal
          adornment, unguents for anointing, besides amulets, charms, and
          images in endless variety and abundance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dwelling of
          Benoni, though not far away, was shut off from the noise and
          confusion by a high street-wall in the rear, while in front the
          sloping grounds extended directly to the wide, silvery Cydnus.
          There were three broad terraces, with here and there clusters of
          acacias, almonds, spice-trees, roses, oleander, and jasmine between
          the winding paths. At intervals there were rustic seats sheltered
          by bowers of flowering plants and shrubs.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The house was
          two stories in height, substantial but not pretentious, and built
          around a quadrangular court. While not ornate, it was attractive
          and well propor<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page10">[pg
          10]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>tioned. The flat roof was surrounded by a low
          parapet, and was furnished with a few wicker seats covered with
          simple canopies. During the mild seasons the family spent much time
          upon the roof, especially in the early morning and evening
          hours.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The simple
          carvings and embellishments of the house were Hebraic in design,
          and many of the utensils were deeply suggestive of ancient
          symbolism and ritual. Extending around the interior court was a
          cornice carved in low relief, with designs depicting scenes from
          the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the receiving of the Law by
          Moses, the tabernacle, the ark of the covenant, and representations
          of the Temple at Jerusalem, its courts, and the seven golden
          candlesticks. In the atrium, or principal apartment, stood an
          ancient cabinet, in which was preserved with great care, in many
          wrappings, a scroll of parchment, upon which was inscribed a record
          of the direct genealogical line of descent from Abraham, through
          the tribe of Benjamin, down to Benoni. The very atmosphere of this
          house of <span class="tei tei-q">“a Hebrew of the Hebrews”</span>
          was almost redolent with the odor of incense, and its flavor was
          that of instituted feasts and festivals.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tarsus, though
          advanced in sophistical logic and philosophy, was in its leading
          characteristics morally depraved. The seat of celebrated schools of
          letters, it was, at the same time, the home of Eastern cults, whose
          mad sensuality and weird superstition made up a pagan corruption
          rarely equalled. A part of its idolatry consisted of the very types
          and ideals of luxurious effeminacy, gluttony, and sensuality. The
          iridescent film of intellectual culture, which was drawn over the
          mass of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page11">[pg 11]</span><a name=
          "Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>moral degradation,
          gave it a charm and external refinement which was more seductive
          than naked barbarism. One of the chief festivals included the
          worship, with elaborate rites, of statues of Sardanapalus and
          Semiramis, upon the base or pedestal of which was engraved,—</p>

          <div class="tei tei-lg" style=
          "margin-left: 2.00em; margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">
              <span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">“EAT, DRINK,
              ENJOY THYSELF; THE REST IS NOTHING.”</span>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the Jews of
          the Dispersion who dwelt in Tarsus, the spectacles of heathenism
          inspired in general a sense of disgust. The very bigotry with which
          their economy had become incrusted formed a kind of protection
          against which a more plastic and characterless religion would have
          measurably yielded. Under the intense glare of the law such a
          paganism appeared in all its abnormal deformity. The Jew was no
          sophist or sentimentalist; and the Tarsian iniquity and abandon,
          far from being attractive, strongly confirmed him in his own
          traditions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prejudices
          of Phariseeism surrounded the very cradle of the son of Benoni.
          Intolerance, fanaticism, national pride, and exclusiveness built
          themselves deeply into the organism of his childish nature. At the
          age of five he had learned many passages from the sacred rolls of
          parchment, and at six he could recite the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Shema”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hallel.”</span> At seven he was taken to his
          <span class="tei tei-q">“vineyard,”</span> or school, which was
          attached to the synagogue; and at ten he commenced the simpler
          doctrines of the oral law which were collected in the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Mishna.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Abdiel, the
          priest, often came to visit the family, and was zealous touching
          the training of Saulus in ritual and tradition. But though the
          vision of the triumph of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page12">[pg
          12]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“the
          uncircumcised”</span> had never been repeated, intervening years
          had not entirely destroyed its portentous impression, even though
          he had feigned to forget it. Thirteen years had passed, and the son
          of Benoni had been confirmed as a <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of
          the Commandment.”</span> He was now prepared to go up to Jerusalem
          for the acquirement of a deeper learning in one of the great
          schools of the prophets where he might become a Rabbi.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Benoni also had
          two daughters, the elder of whom had married long before, and
          removed from Tarsus. Rebecca, the younger, was three years older
          than Saulus, and was known among the Greeks of the neighborhood as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the beautiful Jewess.”</span> No brother
          and sister could be more devotedly attached to each other; and
          their interests, studies, and recreations were shared in common.
          They were quite unlike in nature and disposition; but, as is often
          the case, this seemed to strengthen their bond of affection. Each
          supplied what was lacking in the other. He was intense, impetuous,
          and unyielding, while she was placid and rarely ruffled even under
          great provocation. Though of recognized Jewish type in feature and
          form, she was faultless even from the artistic standpoint of the
          Greek. The artlessness and innocence which from a pure soul also
          shone out through her personality lent an additional charm. She
          usually appeared with her jet-black hair gathered in two ample
          braids falling gracefully behind, and interspersed near the ends
          with golden threads, terminating in a small ornament with pendants.
          A silken cap of light fabric and delicate shading rested lightly
          upon her head, and around her neck was a network of delicate chains
          intermingled with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page13">[pg
          13]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>precious stones. The folds of her white
          loose-fitting robe were gathered by a braided scarlet girdle,
          ornamented with delicate pendants of pearl; and her neck and arms
          were but lightly covered by a gauze scarf, upon which was a
          scattered embroidery of golden thread. Every detail of personality
          and costume indicated a refinement which was genuine and
          graceful.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the close of
          one sultry August day, the family were seated in their usual cosey
          corner upon the house-top, as was their wont in warm weather. The
          fierce Cilician sun was just sinking behind the great brown Taurus
          mountains in the western horizon. The furnace-like air of the great
          shimmering plain to the north and west, which had been wavy with
          heat, was reluctantly yielding to a more endurable temperature, and
          the lengthening shadows gradually softened the glare of the broad
          landscape which stretched away beyond the city to the great
          mountain wall in the distant haze. The silvery current of the
          Cydnus, with its foliage-lined banks, could be followed by the eye,
          winding its zigzag way, and narrowing in the dim distance almost to
          a thread when traced toward its native mountain hiding-place. The
          purple light, which lingered about the summits of the far-away
          range, had a weird and foreboding look; and the great chasm in the
          Taurus, into which the orb of day had plunged, glowed with an
          unwonted and sullen obstinacy as it slowly yielded to the darkening
          shadows. A few heavy clouds which hung over the highest peaks were
          lined with a crimson glory, which, while gorgeous, seemed restless
          and fateful.</p>

          revery. Silence long prevailed. All were gazing, not so much at the
          white roofs and gilded domes beyond the Cydnus, toward which they
          faced, nor upon the garden in the immediate foreground, as into the
          vista of the future. Eyes were looking out, but thoughts were
          turned within.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What of the
          morrow? What of the far-reaching consequences of the movement just
          to begin? Kaleidoscopic visions of coming days flitted through
          their minds. Stillness prevailed over the city. The very atmosphere
          was stagnant. The household of Benoni seemed to have a prophetic
          foregleam of great events, but their character and detail were
          hidden in the impenetrable mists of the future.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus was
          seated beside his mother, with her arm encircling him, and her hand
          gently stroking his cheek. To-morrow they were to part. Rebecca was
          the first to break the silence. She drew herself to the other side
          of her brother, and taking his hand in her own, gave him a warm
          kiss upon his cheek.</p>

          mother had buried her face in her hands, he gently drew them aside

          evening had gathered, and anon the clear full moon appeared above
          the horizon, flooding the broad expanse of white roofs with a pale,
          misty light. The Cydnus hurried quietly past, gleaming like a
          stream of molten silver. By a general impulse the little group
          awakened from their quietude.</p>

          outer costume, made their way down one of the well-worn paths to
          the river’s bank. Unlocking the little boat-house, Saulus pushed
          the light shallop to the landing, and the two stepped in for an
          excursion. The young Israelite grasped the oars with his usual
          alacrity; and the scions of the house of Benoni glided out upon the
          stream and quickly disappeared, making their way against the broad
          current of the Cydnus.</p>

          moment he dealt the Greek a powerful blow, which caused him to
          measure his length on the bear-skin rugs that were spread upon the
          polished, inlaid floor. Then, clapping his hands for a slave to
          assist him, they bore the prostrate Leander into an adjoining
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page21">[pg 21]</span><a name="Pg021"
          id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>chamber, and deposited him
          upon a couch. Marcius then returned to receive the latest
          guest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the
          episode just narrated had been going on, there had come floating in
          from a distance the tones of unseen minstrelsy—now swelling, now
          diminishing—in a way to hold the soul spellbound. This was an
          accompaniment to the nightly revelry and orgies.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Adjoining the
          apartment where the comrades had held converse, and separated from
          it by heavy draperies, was a large banquet-room, and still beyond,
          the room from whence came the strains of music. Mingled with the
          melody and with the measured rhythm of the dance, there escaped
          fragments of hilarity, merrymaking, and the echo of voices in
          pleasing confusion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All the
          apartments and their accessories were eloquent with a voluptuous
          refinement. Culture, wealth, and depravity seemed here to form a
          close combination. The occupants evidently were of patrician blood,
          corrupted by luxury and sensuality, while the pictures, statuary,
          symbols, and images indicated that their oft-invoked divinities
          were as cruel and degenerate as themselves. The whole interior of
          the palace was an intricate but beautiful maze, arranged to confuse
          and captivate the senses. It was one of those highly organized
          efforts, in a luxurious and depraved age, in a heathen metropolis,
          to storm the citadels of supposed pleasure, and to compel the
          inverted mechanism of Nature herself to yield without reserve the
          last charm that is contained in her storehouse. Art, nature, the
          flowers, the stars, rhythm, melody, beauty, and feeling, with
          cruelty and brutality interwoven—everything was placed <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>under contribution in the mad and
          exhaustive search for a perfect sentient paradise. It was an age
          when the senses and instincts of mankind seemed to reach a climax
          of abnormity, while outwardly gilded with artistic charm and
          gracefulness. It was an era of intellectual delusion and spiritual
          insanity. Man must crowd and surfeit his baser nature to the
          bursting-point to-day, for to-morrow he is not.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The palace was
          brilliant with numberless lights; and the warm air was heavy with
          the odors of myrrh, violets, jasmine, and other flowers and spices.
          Fountains cast up a delicate spray which glittered like star-dust
          in their pulsating prismatic play. Mirrors of polished steel
          duplicated every beautiful object, dazzled the bewildered senses,
          and flung chaplets of rosy chains around the soul of every captive
          and victim. To breathe the magic air was to experience a delicious
          intoxication.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vaulted
          ceilings of the principal apartments were frescoed with a sky in
          which were floating fleecy clouds of rosy hue, from the midst of
          which smiled faces of bewildering shape and beauty.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the dances
          and religious processions that were painted upon panels trooped
          forms of the divinest beauty, bearing garlands and chaplets and
          lyres, keeping time to the soft minstrelsy of melody which seemed
          to issue from the very walls. Every ornament, picture, and statue
          silently chanted an invitation to <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">ENJOY</span></span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The door from
          below opened, and Chloe ushered the pure Jewish maiden into the
          presence of Marcius. But she came not alone. The small brother,
          though uninvited, appeared also, and they were hand in hand.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus plied the
          oars with a steady stroke that would have done credit to more
          mature muscles, and the light shallop with its precious freight
          glided rapidly over the mirror-like surface of the Cydnus. The air
          was laden with fragrant exhalations from spicy shrubs, the bending
          branches of which hung over the water on either bank; the grounds
          immediately upon the river being generally laid out in gardens,
          which, like those of Benoni, extended to the water’s edge. The lily
          and rose-tree, the oleander and mulberry, each made its
          contribution of sweet odors, while their misty shadows quivered
          upon the surface of the water as the two moved gently by. Out of
          the thick foliage, here and there, came the song of a nightingale,
          the soft whistle of a quail, or the cooing of a turtle-dove calling
          its mate, perchance disturbed by the plash of the oars.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The poetic
          inspiration and openness to nature’s voices, so prominent during
          the former days of Jewish psalmody and prophecy, had greatly
          decayed under the influence of a harsh formalism. The children of
          Benoni, while not indifferent to the beauty about them, were rather
          dwelling amid vague visions of the future.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The full moon
          was now almost overhead. The even<span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a>ing air, while calm, had a preternatural
          closeness and intensity. A portentous pause prevailed—a lingering
          as if on the brink of fateful destiny. Nature seemed prophetically
          to be holding her breath. But the reveries of the scions of Benoni
          were not disturbed by portentous signs. Nothing so motionless could
          cause them to forget the riches of ancient Hebrew lore, or obscure
          the bright plans in the near future for Saulus. As each was wrapped
          in meditation, some time passed without a word being spoken. But at
          length strains of music in the far distance came floating over the
          water, and Saulus was aroused by their suggestiveness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rebecca took up
          her favorite instrument, and soon the echoes of her pure voice with
          its dulcet accompaniment floated out over the waves.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Other songs and
          chants of the Chosen People followed; and then the Holy City, the
          Temple, and its services formed the theme of converse.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The time had

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The shallop was
          quickly put about, and Saulus grasped the oars for a steady pull;
          but, as they turned their gaze <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page25">[pg 25]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>down the river, the white roofs and towers of
          the city were hidden by a great black curtain.</p>

          "tei tei-q">“O my Rebecca! a tempest is at hand!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus bent to
          the oars with an energy born of desperation. Soon a blinding flash
          of lightning illumined the broad expanse, followed by a heavy peal
          of thunder.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob will be with

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The storm came
          on apace. The density of the darkness was intensified by the
          lightning-flashes which like great darting serpents thrust
          themselves athwart the sky. The fierce roar of the wind was now
          mingled with the thunder; and although Saulus struggled heroically
          to keep the sharp prow to the wind, the little craft was borne
          uncontrollably along, barely being kept upright.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O God of our fathers! Thou who didst bring Israel

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They were swept
          along; and when the boat was just about to fill, it was dashed
          violently upon the shore. The momentum which crushed their frail
          bark as it struck landed them suddenly upon the ground.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The children of
          Benoni were saved. Partially stunned, but otherwise unharmed, they
          arose, and in each other’s embrace looked up, and thanked the God
          of Israel for deliverance. Turning to explore their landing-place,
          they found themselves in the yard of a large house or palace, which
          was brilliantly lighted, and from which issued the confused noise
          of voices, mingled with music and laughter.</p><span class=

          Saulus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On either side
          of the yard was a high wall, and nothing remained but to knock at
          the Cydnus gate of the palace for admission and relief. They were
          kindly received in the basement by the slaves in attendance, who
          took them in, and administered warmth and refreshment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length Chloe,
          the head female slave, who had informed Marcius of their sad
          plight, received a message from him. She turned to Rebecca.</p>

          conducted her up-stairs into the presence of the Roman, and Saulus
          followed unbidden.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius advanced
          with a gracious bow, taking no notice of the boy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius, heated
          by the wine which he had drunk with Leander, gradually became more

          ears. He looked into the next room where Leander, though but
          partially stunned by his blow, was lying in a stupor of
          intoxication. He then resumed his seat, and again turned towards

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The surging of
          human passion, the constancy of affection, the happiness and misery
          of common life, the epochs of trial and triumph, and the mystery of
          fate, all span the wide chasms of time and space. Human life is
          one. Its outward circumstances may be never so varied, but within
          there is a universal correspondence. Through some shape, in the
          evolution of character, the same battles must be fought and the
          same victories won. Customs, races, languages, and governments come
          and go; but love, hate, friendship, passion, vice, and virtue
          remain. The Present is only the Past with a new countenance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Hebrew
          maiden and her young brother remained <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          and confident with assurance. They had an unmistakable vision of
          deliverance, and felt that it was at hand. Its form or manner they
          could not divine. There is an intrinsic faculty which awakens in
          some souls, and takes hold upon the future. It feels coming events
          as though they were already present. That it is not commonly
          developed by no means proves its non-existence. It deals with great
          crises or turning-points, rather than their details.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius sat
          watching the tiny stream of sand as it passed through the small

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The answer came
          from an unexpected quarter. A flash of forked lightning illumined
          the palace, and rent it from roof to foundation. Marcius was
          prostrated and lay as one dead. The Hebrew children, though stunned
          and momentarily unconscious, soon aroused themselves. There was a
          panic in the palace, and a hurrying to and fro of all who had
          escaped unharmed. A part of the slaves, thinking the building was
          about to fall, unbarred the front portal and hurried into the
          street. Saulus and Rebecca, hand in hand, fled down the broad
          stairway, where they met Chloe, who was hastily gathering up a few
          valuables before making her escape.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great Temple
          which crowned the summit of Mount Moriah in the Holy City formed
          the visible pivotal centre of Judaism, and was the pride and joy of
          every son and daughter of Israel. It was surrounded by a broad
          porch, which extended entirely around its four sides, forming a
          most imposing feature and approach. Immediately within was the
          great court of the Gentiles, which enclosed the more exclusive
          courts and the Temple proper. Then came the court of the Women, and
          next beyond, and extending on three sides around the court of the
          Priests and inner Temple, was the court of Israel. Here was located
          the session-room of the Sanhedrin; and near by, or adjoining, was
          the great lecture-room of Gamaliel. This eminent Rabban of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the school of Hillel”</span> was held in
          great respect for his wisdom; and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page33">[pg 33]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>the most promising youth of the tribes, far
          and near, gathered to become his pupils. While a legal Israelite
          and nominal Pharisee, he was tolerant, and permitted great liberty
          in discussion. His students, being from many different provinces,
          embraced among their number not only Pharisees and Sadducees of
          different grades, but also many adherents of other sects and
          philosophies. Some of the Essenes, Gnostics, and those of
          Hellenistic and Aramaic opinion of various shades, including even
          Cyrenians and Alexandrians, sent their sons to this famous Hebrew
          university. Many of its students were quite familiar with Greek
          literature and philosophy. The widespread reputation of Gamaliel,
          and the liberty of private opinion which he permitted, gave his
          school a broad and cosmopolitan character, as contrasted with the
          smaller Rabbinical schools, which often simply taught the letter of
          the Jewish law. It was an <span class="tei tei-q">“Assembly of the
          Wise,”</span> where a degree of freedom was enjoyed which was
          probably unparalleled in its era.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gamaliel
          occupied a high seat or tribune in his assembly-room, while his
          students were grouped around and below him, literally <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“at his feet.”</span> At stated times there were
          dialectical discussions, when he was more their moderator than
          teacher.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps some
          text of Old Testament Scripture would be taken for the subject of
          commentary. Various interpretations were then given; a comparison
          with other religions instituted, aphorisms defined, different
          writers compared, allegories translated, and opinions and
          authorities quoted and discussed. The pupils were encouraged to
          criticise each other, and to question the Rabban, and divergent
          views were expressed and invited.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the
          Talmud, the remarkable body of Rabbinical jurisprudence could well
          be compared to the Roman body of civil law, or even with English
          common law, in the vast accumulation of precedents, arguments, and
          opinions. It included not merely Jewish theology, but the whole
          civil code and practice. From the best accounts, this Hebrew
          university bore some resemblance to the discussions of Plato in the
          Academy, or the lectures of Aristotle in the Lyceum. The students
          received an excellent training in dialectics; and many became not
          only good logicians, but capable of felicitous literary style and
          poetic expression.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
          university there were incipient sects, parties, and factions of
          various shades, often with their recognized leaders or exponents.
          The great Rabban, within reasonable limits, encouraged the spirit
          of free thought and inquiry.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus, being of
          ardent temperament, soon became not only an eager and untiring
          student, but an intense partisan. He rapidly became noted for his
          powerful invective towards his opponents, and even though but a
          boy, was so jealous of the traditions of the fathers that many
          times he was involved in disputes and quarrels. Intellectually
          acute and with retentive memory, his mind was well stored with
          <span class="tei tei-q">“hard sentences of old,”</span> and
          confirmatory quotations from the Scriptures were always at his
          command. Moreover, he gradually became belligerent, and was ready
          to fight for his opinions. Instead of being softened or modified by
          the variety of elements which surrounded him, he grew more
          aggressive. His intemperate zeal led him towards intolerance and
          even <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page35">[pg 35]</span><a name=
          "Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>persecution, so far
          as his position rendered it possible. As a strict literalist, he
          soon persuaded himself that those who were careless of the letter
          of the law were accursed of God, and therefore not deserving of
          much mercy at the hands of man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The khan, or
          inn, where Saulus and a few other ultra Pharisees lived, was a
          headquarters for zealous literalists, and fronted upon a square
          known as the Sheepmarket, which was a little to the north of Mount
          Moriah, and but a short distance from the Tower of Antonia. It was
          but a few minutes’ walk from the Sheepgate, which was one of the
          portals in the city wall which led eastward through the Valley of
          Jehosaphat to Gethsemane and the Mount of Olives beyond.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the pupils
          of Gamaliel was one, Victor Serenus by name, who had become the
          recognized leader of an important following in the assembly.
          Although three years older than Saulus, they were members of the
          same class. He was a native of Alexandria, Egypt, and his parents
          were liberal Jewish Hellenists. He was rather tall,
          well-proportioned, of blond complexion, and had a mass of wavy
          chestnut hair, which crowned a face and head of ideal form and
          expression. The sparkle and clearness of his dark blue eyes indexed
          a delicate soul and noble nature. A marked repose and lofty
          bearing, combined with brightness and optimism in his demeanor,
          formed a combination as rare as it was attractive. An inward purity
          and strength of soul seemed tangibly to shine out through his
          physical organism. He had early possessed the advantages of the
          best intellectual culture of his native city, and was an intimate
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span><a name="Pg036"
          id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>friend and associate of
          Philo, who then was just beginning to lay the foundation for the
          world-wide reputation which he afterwards gained as an eminent
          writer and philosopher. Though not a member of any Jewish sect, he
          was familiar with the doctrines of the Gnostics, Essenes,
          Therapeutæ, and other systems of the Jewish dispersion. Belonging
          definitely to no one of them, he seemed to have absorbed a large
          measure of the truth contained in all, leaving behind their
          limitations and exclusiveness. Soon after coming to the Holy City
          to supplement an education already of unusual quality, he gradually
          became the recognized leader of the broadest and most liberal
          element of the assembly. This came about not from any
          aggressiveness, but from innate quality and character, the power of
          which could not be hidden.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
          hand, Saulus, from inherent brilliancy and great force of
          character, became the recognized champion of the dogmatists and
          literalists. It naturally happened, that, in the free discussions
          which were permitted by Rabban Gamaliel, Serenus and Saulus found
          themselves at the head of opposing factions.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">
            &nbsp;
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The seasons flew
          rapidly by, and the fourth year of Saulus’s life in the Holy City
          was drawing to a close. Although still small in stature, his growth
          in mental acquirement and intensity since he had entered the school
          of Gamaliel had been remarkable. His rather insignificant physical
          appearance had considerable compensation in an executive talent and
          power which easily marked him as a born leader of men. With plain
          and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page37">[pg 37]</span><a name=
          "Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>unattractive features
          of the pronounced Jewish type, and a mixture of pale and red in his
          complexion, he was outwardly commonplace; but when enlisted in
          disputation a quick flush would pass over his countenance, and,
          with changed expression, the commanding dignity and fire of his
          bearing would astonish all beholders. Loyal to his convictions and
          faithful to his friends, he was at the same time intolerant,
          impetuous, and terrible toward all whom he regarded as opposers of
          the strictest Jewish economy. His violent temper made itself felt
          in his orations and debates, and already had involved him in
          several tumults and perils. After receiving repeated warnings from
          Rabban Gamaliel, he had barely escaped formal condemnation and
          dismissal. Tendencies had already developed and antagonisms been
          definitely formed that were destined to play an important part in
          coming time.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the brief
          and tempestuous reign of Archelaus, the son and successor of Herod
          the Great, the Roman Emperor, Cæsar Augustus, in order to humiliate
          the Holy City, had removed the seat of the Judean government to
          Cæsarea, Jerusalem thereby becoming a secondary provincial city.
          During this period the high priest, Annas, who was thoroughly the
          creature of the Roman dominion, kept up the semblance of a court in
          the Herodian palace on Mount Zion. Every considerable Judean town
          and city was garrisoned with Roman soldiers. The Tower of Antonia
          was held by a strong force, and Roman guards kept every gate of the
          city and palace. Merciless taxation and exaction kept the Jews in
          abject subjugation. Having lost every vestige of political
          independence, they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg
          38]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>now
          devoted themselves more closely than ever before to the complicated
          ceremonialism of their national religion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just adjoining
          and opening out of Gamaliel’s main auditorium was a commodious
          hall, known as the Lyceum, which was used for the informal
          disputations of the pupils of the assembly. Here at stated times
          were discussed various questions of philosophy, law, theology, and
          especially the doctrines and interpretation of the Jewish
          Scriptures. On these occasions, which were quite distinct from the
          regular and official exercises of the assembly, some one of the
          students often presided, and the sessions were open to the public
          of all classes. Here were often gathered Jews of high and low
          degree, scribes, Pharisees, Sadducees, and publicans, both from the
          city and provinces, with a sprinkling of Greeks and Romans; so that
          not infrequently there were seen mingled in the mass the broad
          phylactery of a Rabbi, the gorgeous costume of a centurion, or the
          gilded helmet of a soldier of the garrison. The Holy City was full
          of factions, some of which were bigoted, fanatical, and even
          bloodthirsty; and often representatives of these classes would be
          found in the Lyceum, drawn thither by the warmth and excitement of
          the disputations. Nothing less than the iron grip of Rome could
          keep all these pent-up elements in outward order and subjection;
          but, in spite of all repression, outbreaks and persecutions were
          frequent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Slightly raised
          and back of the tribune from which the speakers made their
          arguments was a gallery reserved for women, who were freely
          admitted to these informal debates.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Roman rule,
          though politically tyrannous, was entirely tolerant, as to all
          questions of philosophy and religion, so long as its own political
          control was not disturbed. It did not trouble itself about the
          institutes of Moses, the Psalms of David, the messages of the
          prophets, the speculations of Greek philosophy, or the doctrines of
          the scribes and Pharisees, so long as Cæsar’s mandates were
          unquestioned and his tribute willingly rendered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the voice
          of Saulus; and his words, uttered in vehement tones, rang through
          the Lyceum. His countenance was flushed, hands tightly clinched,
          and his gestures violent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A tumult of
          applause followed from the ultra-Pharisaical party, who were all
          partisans of Saulus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hall was
          thronged with a motley crowd from the streets, including people of
          all degrees, as well as the pupils of Gamaliel. The disputation was
          one of unwonted fervor, so that several were finally drawn into it
          who had come in only as lookers-on. The Rabban was not present;
          and, as the controversy became heated, the young student who was
          presiding found it impossible to preserve any semblance of
          order.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Victor Serenus
          arose to answer the argument of Saulus, who had ended a long
          harangue for Jewish exclusiveness with the words above given. His
          commanding presence, serene bearing, and perfect self-command
          caused a sud<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page41">[pg
          41]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>den
          hush. With dignified mien and a graceful wave of the hand he
          commenced his argument.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I bring you peace, but I must judge righteously. I
          also am a Jew of the Dispersion, but must call in question the
          conclusion of the matter as given by my friend Saulus. As a native
          of Alexandria, a friend of Philo, and a disciple of the eminent and
          tolerant Rabban, my voice is for spiritual freedom. To-day, O
          fellow-members of the Assembly! I openly wash my hands of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘mint, anise, and cummin’</span> of the
          sect of the Pharisees. I hesitate no longer to boldly affirm the
          truth which I have long felt stirring within me. The traditions
          taught by the scribes and elders have become burdens upon men’s
          shoulders too grievous to be longer borne. God is God over all, and
          no respecter of persons. He is not merely a tribal Deity, local and
          Jewish, but the Father of all nations and peoples to the ends of
          the earth.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The liberal
          faction, including a few Greeks and Romans who were scattered among
          the throng, signified their approval, while the adherents of Saulus
          cried out with fierce exclamations of condemnation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A little apart
          from the common seats, in the gallery of the women, was a place
          especially reserved for the wives and daughters of the Rabban and
          his friends. Here was seated a young girl who was an interested
          observer of the disputation. As we shall have somewhat to do with
          her in the future, a brief introduction is not amiss. Her features,
          which were mildly of the Jewish type, were very regular and
          beautiful, and her bearing and expression bore evidence of grace
          and refinement. Her form was of medium size, willowy and
          symmetrical; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page42">[pg
          42]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and
          from under rather prominent brows and lashes shone out large soft
          dark eyes, radiantly expressive and ingenuous. She was in the early
          flush of youth. A richly embroidered Syrian gauze scarf was wrapped
          lightly about her head; and her dark locks, which slightly curled,
          were loosely gathered in a light golden clasp, which was ornamented
          with pearls, at the back of the neck. She wore a robe of delicate
          hue, which was clasped lightly about her form, simply but richly
          ornamented. While outwardly serene, there seemed to be that within
          the damsel which, perchance, could be stirred into a tempest of
          feeling, and melt the outward reserve by its warmth and intensity.
          If there was the slight semblance of coldness, it was so thin as to
          be almost transparent. She bore a dignified air of quality, not as
          signifying pride or exclusiveness, but as if the outward form was
          only the setting of a precious gem. A spiritual interpreter would
          have divined the subtile individual richness as rare soul-quality.
          But withal her eyes were the dazzling feature of her whole
          personality. They might truly be defined as both melting and
          penetrative. The warmth of a pure and lovely soul was poured out
          through them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the tumult
          continued, Victor Serenus turned about; and while carelessly
          surveying the throng, his glance met that of the damsel, which
          seemed to be intently fastened upon him. Serenus was thrilled, as
          by an electric shock, and for a moment forgot the uproar, his
          argument—himself. The innocent cause of this unwonted perturbation
          was Amabel, the only daughter of the Rabban. The clamor of the
          throng died away, and Serenus quickly recovered himself and
          continued,—</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page43">[pg

          the spirit of the law hath been killed by the letter. O brothers of

          ordinances and ceremonies, and be interpreters of the truth, not
          only to the Gentiles, but to the families of Israel. If ye have an
          indwelling experience of a divine faith, the outward letter of
          sacrifices, anointings, phylacteries, and disfigured faces is but
          chaff and without meaning. O my brothers! we must, from the heart,
          have such a purity of mind and thought that our very bodies shall
          become incarnations of divinity. A true revelation of the Spirit of
          Truth is not vouchsafed unto the worldly-wise and prudent, but to
          the childlike, the poor in spirit, and the pure in heart. The
          heavenly germ is within; but no man knoweth it, until it be
          quickened into life, when it bringeth forth a witness of
          fruits,—love, joy, peace, and healing. I adjure you, that as ye

          reap a Gehenna in yourselves and in your members. Ye say:

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus and his
          partisans rose up to lay hold of him; but in a moment Serenus was
          surrounded by a body of defenders, who insisted that he should be
          heard. The clamor increased until the chairman called upon a

          the midst, to order the tumult stayed. The Roman captain slowly
          arose, and with an air of mingled dignity and disdain, commanded

          still stood calmly in his place in the tribune, without a trace,

          not long tarry. The God of the whole earth is to be worshipped by
          Jew and Gentile alike. The religion of the Hebrew is to burst its
          bonds; for with it must be mingled the best of the philosophy,
          mind, and ideals of the Greek and other Gentile nations. The many

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The morning was
          bright; and a light, cool breeze from the Taurus mountains swept
          down the valley of the Cydnus, bathing the city of Tarsus with its
          freshness. The sun had just risen, and was beginning to quaff his
          fill of mist and dew, and to kiss with a golden sheen the towers,
          roofs, sails, and masts of the Cilician metropolis. But though the
          hour was yet early, the city was already astir. Buyers and sellers
          in the open markets by the city gates were scattered in little
          groups, and chaffered over their traffic with the easy air of
          Oriental contentment. The streets and lanes wore a more busy aspect
          than was wont; and the number of people in festal costumes,
          hurrying to and fro with garlands and palm-branches in their hands,
          betokened a general holiday.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-lg" style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the most
          important of the festivals of Apollo, and was celebrated annually
          by a grand procession to the chief temple of the city; followed by
          sacrifices, priestly rites and ceremonies, oracular messages and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page48">[pg 48]</span><a name="Pg048"
          id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>predictions, sorcery and
          soothsaying, ending at night, with orgies which characterized the
          Oriental city of the period.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The main temple
          with its oracle, consecrated to the gods of Tarsus, was situated in
          the midst of a large garden in the extreme northwestern, or most
          elevated part of the city. It commanded a charming view of the
          beautiful Cydnus for nearly its whole length, as it wound its way,
          like a silver thread, through the plain in its course from the
          distant mountains to the sea. The ground about the temple was
          tastefully laid out with walks, vine-clad summer-houses, fountains,
          grottos, groups of sycamore and palm trees, and at short intervals
          adorned with statues, vases, and other creations of Greek art and
          handiwork.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The blossoms of
          the bending branches of spicy plants loaded the air with sweet
          odors, which held the visitor in the delicate bonds of a subtile
          enchantment. The oleander and jasmine, rose and lilac, tulip and
          lily, each lent its charm to the chorus of beauty and exhalation.
          Bounteous Nature was drawn upon to the utmost for rich
          contributions to consecrate Apollo’s great temple-garden, and
          enhance its mystical fascination.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In threading
          one’s way through this sensuous paradise, one would often find
          himself at the entrance of some graceful booth, where a priest or
          priestess of Apollo would dispense love-philtres, or be inquired of
          concerning the misty future, peradventure to its complete
          unveiling.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The temple
          itself was built of Parian marble, and surrounded by a porch, with
          a row of lofty Corinthian <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page49">[pg
          49]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>columns in front, and a corresponding
          peristyle, surmounted by an entablature, stretching out from either
          side. The pediments were richly covered with designs in
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">alto-rilievo</span></span>. Among them were
          representations of Apollo, Diana, the setting sun, Hercules slaying
          the Hydra, Dionysus and a Giant, Fauns, Bacchantes, and triumphal
          processions. In the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">pronaos</span></span>, or vestibule, there was
          a series of broad panels, upon which were inscribed maxims from the
          Seven Sages of Greece.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Beyond the
          vestibule, on either side were two overflowing fountains, each
          surrounded with statues of Triton, Neptune, Amphitrite, Apollo
          slaying the great serpent Pytho, with other gods, goddesses,
          Nymphs, and Dryads. Invalids who drank of a certain fountain, or
          bathed in it, and were healed, threw pieces of money into it as a
          recompense. In the back part of the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cella</span></span> was the great hearth with
          the perpetual fire; and in the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">adytum</span></span>, or inner shrine, were
          the sacred tripod and other mysteries of the sanctum. Below this
          was a subterranean chamber, from the sacred recesses of which
          ascended the vapor of prophecy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The oracular
          messages were often conveyed by dreams, preceding which, fasting
          was customary, followed by sacrifices, and sleeping upon the skin
          of the animal which had been offered. Other auguries were received
          in writing, sometimes by means of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“descending pencil”</span> which hung suspended, and
          wrote by invisible, though intelligent and fateful impulse. Sealed
          communications on parchment also received answers from occult and
          mysterious sources.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Magic, prophecy,
          and oracular deliverances were not <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page50">[pg 50]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>peculiar to the great Oracle at Delphi, but
          common in the less noted temples of other cities. The offices of
          priest and soothsayer were blended. The favor and guidance of the
          gods were invoked upon every undertaking, and through sacrifice and
          propitiation offered their friendly aid was bestowed. Nothing was
          undertaken without their sanction, whether going to war, engaging
          in business, or making love. The healing of invalids, augury, and
          the interpretation of visions, were not only legal and ethical, but
          they formed an integral part of religion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the modern
          student of mental phenomena it is interesting to look back upon the
          multiform manifestations of mind in the past. Under the reign of
          polytheism, everything—including even the inner psychological
          forces that are common to all—was deified. Each phenomenon was due
          to the action of some <span class="tei tei-q">“god.”</span> But
          after all, when we get below the surface of things, is the change a
          very radical one? The <span class="tei tei-q">“god,”</span> with
          them, is some divine orderly law with us. Either term involves the
          idea of a force which is more or less mysterious. They were
          destitute of the understanding of the inherent unity and
          inter-relation of all things, and consequently each phenomenon was
          disconnected from its relations, and directly credited to a special
          deity. There was no idea of a great comprehensive Unit. The
          universe of mind and matter was a fragmentary mass. Its various
          factions were presided over by deities who were often warring
          against each other. The great modern inspiration is, not only
          cosmic oneness, but universality of law. Even the monotheism of the
          Jew was largely mechanical and incongruous.</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page51">[pg 51]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Law as all
          pervading with the latest refinement—its unvarying beneficence,
          when correctly interpreted—furnishes the key which will resolve
          age-long mysteries. With the present understanding of the creative
          power of mental states, and the potency of thought, even when set
          in motion by motives of pure superstition, much of the remarkable
          phenomena of the past can be interpreted and rendered congruous.
          The prophecies, oracular messages, healings, divinations,
          soothsaying, and other <span class="tei tei-q">“miraculous”</span>
          transactions of history, though doubtless often exaggerated, have
          an important basis of truth. They are in accord with the legitimate
          or illegitimate use of laws now measurably understood. As we become
          increasingly aware of the possibilities of hypnotism, telepathy,
          the sub-conscious mind, suggestion, psychical development, and
          spiritualistic experiences, the strange things of both ancient and
          later times are seen to be natural and explainable. The so-called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“supernatural”</span> was just what might
          have been expected under the known conditions. There was no
          suspension of universal law, but only the orderly result of real
          forces which exist in man, even though often unrecognized and
          misused.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under both the
          Gentile and Jewish economies, there was an endless mass of
          occurrences, attributed to special deific intervention, but all
          belong to the realm of the one Divine unchangeable and universal
          order. This has never been suspended and never will be, for God
          does not contradict himself. Prophets and priests could perform
          <span class="tei tei-q">“wonderful works”</span> through the medium
          of principles which they could not define. Miraculous colorings are
          always in the eyes of the beholder. Human equip<span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ment, which has had much unintelligent
          employment, is now clearly interpreted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But withal, it
          may be questioned, whether it be not better to attribute too much
          to <span class="tei tei-q">“the gods”</span> than—like some
          moderns—to become so coldly agnostic and <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=

          everything which is above the plane of the material and
          sensuous.</p>

          father were returning from the morning service of the synagogue,

          unwonted interest.</p>

          her knees, and with tears of gratitude thanked her kind benefactor

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just then the
          distant echoes of cymbals, trumpets, and songs, which betokened the
          coming of the great festal procession, fell upon the ears of the
          trio. It was manifest that its line of march was to be directly
          through the street into which the portal of the bazaar opened,
          where they were standing. Casting their eyes down the long vista
          toward the approaching column, they were spellbound by its grandeur
          as it threaded its way with slow elastic rhythm through the crowded
          thoroughfare. It was on its joyous march to the garden and temple
          of Apollo.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Benoni was first
          to break the silence.</p>

          the enemies of the Lord shall yet be sore vexed.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon the thud of
          hoofs and the rumble of wheels betokened a company of charioteers
          which composed the advance division of the pageant. Each chariot
          was richly decorated with chaplets and ribbons, and drawn
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page54">[pg 54]</span><a name="Pg054"
          id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by three horses abreast, of
          the same color, all gorgeously caparisoned.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The charioteers
          were chanting a chorus:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Near the front,
          and abreast of each other, were two charioteers who merit a
          description somewhat more in detail. The prancing steeds driven by
          one were snowy white, and those of the other jet black. The driver
          of the latter was tall and erect, with head thrown back, long black
          curly hair, dark complexion, strong face, Roman nose, and a
          physical organization which might be the envy of an athlete. His
          head was bare, with the exception of a wreath of myrtle, likewise
          his throat, arms, and legs below the knee. His tunic was of crimson
          fabric, woven of silk, gathered by a girdle of gold chain, and
          clasped in front by an elaborate jewelled ornament.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The other was
          more delicate in complexion, with wavy brown hair, dark blue eyes,
          and refined features of the Grecian cast. A chaplet of laurel
          encircled his brow, his throat and arms were bare, and an easy
          gracefulness characterized every movement. The skirt of his belted
          tunic, of soft white woollen fabric, dropped to the knee, and was
          decorated with a border of gold embroidery. The throat, arms, and
          legs, where exposed, had a pearly whiteness which betokened a
          perfect service of baths, oils, and polishing. He was lighter in
          build and less <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page55">[pg

          there was a sparkle in his eyes which certified to a warm and
          poetic temperament. They had arrived at a point just opposite where
          the three were standing, when Chloe gave a start, and turning,
          grasped the arm of Rebecca.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tarsus gave
          itself up with full abandon to the festival. The Tarsian religion
          of the period, though outwardly adorned by the polish of Greek art,
          letters, and philosophy, was largely orgiastic and Oriental in its
          internal character. The popular faith contained a strange mixture
          of Greek, Roman, Phrygian, Phœnician, and even Egyptian elements,
          for the mingling of which the intermediate situation of the
          Cilician metropolis was especially favorable. In Greece itself, a
          terrible decadence had taken place since the earlier philosophy and
          idealism of Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato; but in Tarsus, the
          religion, though nominally Grecian, was permeated with the
          fanaticism and magic of Eastern cults. It was sensual,
          superstitious, and spectacular, though it had an iridescent
          Hellenic film of grace and beauty.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But with all the
          depravity of the period, there was a spontaneity and natural
          optimism, which, while not atoning for its excesses, should not be
          left out of the account. A hard and narrow asceticism, which during
          mediæval ages made life <span class="tei tei-q">“a bed of
          spikes,”</span> was the future great sweep of the human pendulum to
          the other extreme. If there was less seriousness, there was at the
          same time less pessimism and morbidity. The ripening <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page57">[pg 57]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>process in humanity is a matter of
          millenniums, and only in the broad sunshine of the higher
          evolutionary philosophy can proper adjustments and allowances for
          wide vibrations be made.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The law of
          correspondence is universal. The relation between the seen and the
          unseen is not only intimate but perfectly fitting. The soul,
          whether of low or high attainment, has its extension into, and
          connection with, spiritual forces of its own quality and on its own
          plane. By a subtle mysterious union, each mingles with its own.
          Like attracts like. But yet lives of selfishness and sensuality
          have within them the germs of finer instincts; and sooner or later,
          when needed lessons have been learned, there will be a drawing
          upward of the divinity, now latent within, toward its transcendent
          correspondence, even though the recognition long be dim.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Evil is a
          misdirection of forces within that are good <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per
          se</span></span>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every one has
          some supreme ideal; and for the present this concept, even though
          low and limited, is to him godlike—in fact, his god. Human ideals
          of God are ever to rise and become more perfect, for man has all
          potentiality within him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Linked with all
          the corruption of the sensuous age in question, there was a strong
          impulse toward worship. Pantheism recognized a divine ordination of
          all possible unseen forces, as well as seen objects; and then, in
          order not to miss the fulness of religion, it erected altars to the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“unknown God.”</span> The instinct of
          deific devotion was great in quantity, but low in quality. The
          sacred <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page58">[pg 58]</span><a name=
          "Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mysteries were all
          absorbing, but took little hold upon the moral nature.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Weighed by the
          delicate but immutable balances of thought-quality, the morals of
          the various ages might not be so dissimilar. Vice is no less vice
          when it is secretive. The world has learned to dissemble. Before
          the present age can greatly boast of its own moral purity, as
          compared with that of the past, it must apply the inner as well as
          the external test. Even low instincts, when idealized and
          sanctified, are in some measure purified by the quality of thought
          concerning them. If by the accepted ethics of one age, a certain
          course of conduct be not only regular but correct, and by those of
          another low and vile, who shall declare that their moral quality is
          identical? Judgment, to be just, must be tempered, or at least
          somewhat relative rather than absolute. An age which held that
          every real force, sex-principle, and sensuous or artistic instinct
          was some manifestation of, or in close relation with the Deity, or
          deities, should be studied in the clarifying light of the
          evolutionary philosophy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the
          majority of the Tarsian population did not join the procession,
          they generally surrendered fully to the exuberant spirit of the
          occasion, thereby pleasing themselves and gaining the favor of the
          gods. The morning was superb; and the great moving human panorama
          began to unroll itself from the lower part of the city, in a
          stream, kaleidoscopic in its changes, toward the temple. The
          chariots, in column two abreast, led the way, crowding back the
          dense mass of people on either side, thereby clearing a path for
          the less resistant <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page59">[pg
          59]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>portions of the great procession. These were
          followed by companies of men, dressed in various symbolic costumes,
          bearing offerings and instruments which pertained to the mysteries
          of prophecy, music, poetry, and medicine, and the other arts and
          muses. Some bore banners, inscribed with occult signs and emblems;
          others swung smoking censers with a slow rhythmical measure which
          corresponded to the march. Then followed a long procession of
          girls, chanting and dancing to the measured time of the music of
          tabourets and harps which vibrated to their own light touch. Their
          long hair was thrown loosely back to the soft breeze; their faces,
          necks, and arms fully exposed to the sunlight, and their lithe,
          shapely forms and white limbs were but lightly veiled by
          free-flowing pink or golden-hued robes. There were priests wearing
          tall cone-shaped hats, and priestesses with hair coiled and
          intertwined with symbolic leaves, flowers, and garlands, some
          wearing charms and amulets, and waving their wands to the beat of
          the movement. Some bore bunches of grapes or other fruits, and
          others carried small cornucopias of spices and sweets for their
          rich odors and for consumption upon the altars which were about the
          temple. There were also cows, sheep, and goats, bedecked with
          trappings, ribbons, and garlands, for sacrifice, or other symbolic
          ceremonies and priestly rites.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Everything
          beautiful in nature,—its flowers, trees, birds, air, and sunshine,
          lent their charm for the enrichment of the service to the Tarsian
          gods, and the honor of their temple. The chariots of Marcius and
          Leander were prominent in the procession, side by
          side.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page60">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The procession
          wound gracefully through the peristyle on one side and back on the
          other, thence into the avenues of the great garden, finally losing
          itself and melting away in its intricate mazes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After sending
          away their chariots by attendants, Marcius and Leander lingered for
          some time among the bowers and grottoes of the temple grounds.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          bewildering charms of the garden was a shimmering pond in its
          midst, the banks of which were decked with groves of lotus and
          blooming rose-trees. Clustered around the numerous statues,
          delicate jets of perfumed water threw up their fine spray, and
          loaded the air with aromatic fragrance. Graceful shallops, shaped
          like swans or fish, moved about in the pond, filled with lightly
          draped rowers of both sexes, whose gilded oars kept time to the
          music of harps and citharæ, played by girls in unnumbered smaller
          craft which circled around them. Some were dressed as Sirens,
          covered with green net-work in imitation of scales. Trooping out
          from among high clusters of plants and flowers were groups
          disguised as Fauns, Satyrs, Nymphs, and Dryads, playing on
          tabourets, drums, flutes, or tambourines. The water of the pond
          responsively heaved to the rhythm of oars which beat in unison. As
          night drew on, the echoes of voices, horns, and trumpets grew
          louder; and the votaries <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page63">[pg
          63]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
          Bacchus and Venus, amid shouts and laughter, threw all restraint to
          the winds. On the shores and terraces shone swarms of lights, while
          other parts of the groves were dark and hidden.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was late in
          the evening when Marcius and Leander, satiated and sobered by the
          excesses of the day, entered, arm in arm, the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">pronaos</span></span> of the temple. On each
          side were low seats, comfortably cushioned; and by a mutual impulse
          they sat down for a little rest before penetrating farther into the
          interior. The Roman seemed in a dejected mood. His black eyes were
          heavy and dull; and his mien, usually so haughty and imperious, was
          tame and passive. He turned towards Leander.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Slowly rising,
          they made their way into the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cella</span></span> of the temple.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The perpetual
          fire was burning upon the great sacred hearth; and before it were a
          few persons who had prostrated themselves, each waiting the slow
          turn for their introduction to the inner Mysteries. The
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cella</span></span> was unlighted save by the
          fitful glare of the fire on the hearth. The strange symbols and
          inscriptions which covered the walls and ceiling produced a weird
          and unearthly effect.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a recess,
          just above the fire, were great gilded, interlaced triangles, and
          over those the symbolic Winged Globe. These were surrounded with
          divine monograms, emblems of the powers of Nature. On the ceiling
          was a large design of the crux Ansata, the oldest known hieroglyph,
          also the Greek divine Logos representing inner illumination. The
          walls were covered with other mysterious characters,—the key of
          Hermes, the serpent in a circle, cabalistic names, a talisman of
          Pythagoras, monogram of Fire, or the generative principle,
          symbolisms of the divine Wreath, hieroglyph of Eros, monograms of
          the three Delphic mysteries and the re-born soul. Harps of Æolia
          which hung in the valves of the outer walls filled the air with
          sweet and plaintive melody in fitful measure.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius and
          Leander waited for a full hour at the sacred fire for the numbers
          to be called which would give them their turn for an introduction
          to the inner <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page65">[pg
          65]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Mysteria Sacra</span></span>. A feeling of awe
          gradually crept through their souls—a sense of having left the
          world behind. Unseen influences were bearing down upon them. The
          hieroglyphs seemed alive and engaged in an ominous dance, frowning
          upon them and calling them to judgment. They grasped each other’s
          hands, and looked into each other’s eyes to reassure
          themselves.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length the
          number of Marcius was called, and he was ushered into the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">adytum</span></span>. The valve closed behind
          him; and as he passed forward, there hung, directly overhead, a
          great flaming symbol of the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Mysteria
          Eleusinia</span></span>. Its brightness slowly faded until, in a
          little time, it only cast a dim blue ghastly light in flashes, so
          that he could see but indistinctly. He was impelled still farther
          on, and soon a cool breeze swept gently up from cavernous depths
          below. The walls melted and retreated; and the courageous Roman,
          nearly overcome, pinched himself to find if he were still in the
          body. He involuntarily turned to retreat, but the valve had
          disappeared.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Am I alive? or is this Hades?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But see! a vapor
          ascends in the dim blue light from the cavernous realm below. It
          winds itself upward, and anon within it there are great forbidding
          and uncanny Shapes; and with bedeviled mien, leering faces, and
          ominous gestures they beckon to Marcius.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon a pungent
          aromatic odor diffused itself through the air, which mysteriously
          stilled his excited senses so that he regained his wonted
          composure.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The column of
          vapor rolled itself up, growing more dense, and anon something like
          a defined form slowly gathered itself together from it. For a
          little time the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page66">[pg
          66]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>dim
          misty light only revealed indistinct outlines; but soon it grew
          clearer, and advanced a step toward Marcius, a part of the vaporous
          cloud forming a soft background. The transformation now became
          rapid, and anon there stood before him a beautiful young woman.
          With a flash of recognition the heart of the Roman leaped to his
          throat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Alethea!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The light
          increased; and the form, in every detail, stood out with lifelike
          color and distinctness. She wore a long silvery white robe, the
          folds of which were lightly gathered by a girdle, and swept in easy
          lines to her feet. The bare neck, arms, and shoulders were of a
          pale rose-color or flesh-tint, and the bosom palpitated with
          emotion. The face was clear, calm, and natural, with an expression
          of sadness about the eyes; and the blond hair, thrown lightly
          behind the shoulders, reached below the waist. There was breath and
          life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Alethea! Dost thou still live? Was thy death, then, an

          thee still.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tumultuous
          concourse at Gamaliel’s Lyceum dispersed; and Saulus was conveyed,
          under guard, to the Tower of Antonia. Amabel, who had remained in
          her seat, catching every note of the disputation with intense
          interest until its end, stole quietly through the boisterous throng
          as it hurried into the street, and rapidly made her way toward
          home. The palace of her father, the Rabban, was situated on Mount
          Zion, a little to the northeast of the palace of Herod, and
          commanded a fine view of the Holy City and its environs. As she
          passed into the entrance-hall, she started directly to acquaint her
          father with the scene at the Lyceum, but found herself stirred by
          emotions so unusual that she was impelled to pass the portal of his
          library, and go quietly to her own apartment. She must have time to
          think. The air seemed oppressive; and she hurriedly made her way to
          the house-top, where there was a secluded nook to which she often
          resorted for study and meditation. Throwing herself into an easy
          seat, which was sheltered by a light canopy, she mechanically
          looked down upon the gilded towers, domes, and white roofs which
          were spread out below.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page69">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sun, which
          was just sinking, seemed to linger a little upon the summit of the
          western mountains, sportively shooting back his rays, and tinting
          through and through the fleecy cloud-forms which hung lightly over
          the city, burnishing its bastioned walls and battlements. Just
          across the valley of the Cheesemongers, and crowning the summit of
          Mount Moriah, was the great Temple, with its endless courts, each
          marked by long rows of white marble columns, and proudly lifting
          itself in the midst of all, the Holy of Holies, wearing a crown of
          beaten gold. Here was the head and heart of Judaism, including its
          religion, history, law, prophecy, and patriotism, now, alas!
          shackled by the heavy hand of Rome, so that even the simplest daily
          ritual was only possible by the gracious permission of the enemy.
          From the valley immediately to the north the Towers of Mariamne,
          Phasælus, and Hippicus lifted their proud heads; while to the east,
          beyond the Kedron, the bold steeps of the Mount of Olives, scantily
          clothed with fig-trees and wild olives, were softened and bathed in
          a purple haze, the parting gift of the orb of day. Jerusalem, and
          the mountains round about her, were suffused with an ambient air of
          peace and serenity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the soul of
          Amabel did not reflect the calm of the world outside. She gave but
          a passing glance to the familiar surroundings which were wont to be
          so attractive, because a new world within, but just discovered,
          demanded attention.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the loving
          and dutiful daughter of the Rabban, she was loyal to her religion
          and people. She had been feared and educated in the light of its
          more liberal <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page70">[pg
          70]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>teachings, and was deeply interested in their
          promulgation and dominance. But the broader spiritual liberalism of
          Victor Serenus appealed deeply to her. She started to review his
          earnest arguments, but was surprised to find that her thoughts
          constantly glanced from the oration to the orator. After several
          attempts at calm reasoning, Amabel became impatient with herself.
          Intellectually gifted, she never before had failed in the efficient
          command of her faculties. Her interest in religion had been vital,
          and her devotion thorough; but all at once they seemed to have
          faded in the light of a new vision which proved rudely aggressive.
          Again she tried to gather up the eloquent line of reasoning; but
          anon a mental image, its noble bearing, graceful gestures, manly
          form, and most peculiarly <span class="tei tei-q">“those
          eyes”</span> seemed fastened upon her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What have I to do with thee?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her own question
          gave her a shock.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My logic never before hath denied me service. Thou
          mysterious, stately, haunting stranger! Why doth thine eyes shine
          upon me, and thy form possess my imagination? I bid thee
          adieu!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But beyond her
          control something had taken shape and life, and stood before her,
          at the sight of which she was thrilled and spellbound. It was an
          Ideal—her Ideal.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Away, airy phantom! I will be myself!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But an ideal
          that fits its place takes possession. It persistently makes itself
          at home, and receives, not only deserved recognition, but a
          conscious or unconscious welcome.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She tried to
          step outside of herself and look in, in <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page71">[pg 71]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>order to interpret, if possible, the vision
          from an impartial standpoint. Its charm was not lessened.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A mind may be
          deeply intuitive, and even philosophical, and yet naïve and
          artless. With a delightful and childlike simplicity, Amabel was
          unconscious of her own loveliness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She threw aside
          the light scarf from her head; and her hair, somewhat disordered by
          the light breeze, played about the ivory neck which her light robe
          partially displayed. Her cheeks were flushed, and her large dark
          eyes unwontedly shining and liquid. Again she turned her gaze
          within. More truly, the new and mysterious Thing which had
          possessed her was there, rather than in the distance. Its
          correspondence or occasion might be without, but it was a
          subjective force which stirred the Hebrew maiden’s heart. There was
          a new, unfathomable, and heavenly quickening. Something had been
          awakened which no power on earth could turn back to its native
          slumbering latency.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The evening drew
          on, but she was unconscious of the flight of time. A charming and
          divine unrest, which she could not dislodge if she would, filled
          her soul. O daughter of humanity! who shall interpret thee to
          thyself?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She looked out
          upon the lamps that twinkled over the Holy City, but saw only the
          Ideal. The soft evening breeze that fanned her cheek whispered of
          it, and even the starry heavens smiled upon her and reflected it
          back.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">
            * * * * * * * *
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The time sped
          on. Amabel was missed from the evening family repast; and it was
          only after some appre<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg
          72]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class=

          her revery, and took her accustomed place in the household. It was
          taken for granted that she had been sleeping.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Early on the
          following morning, Victor Serenus made his way to the palace of
          Gamaliel, and sought an audience with the Rabban. This was not
          difficult for any member of the assembly; and, besides, Serenus was
          influential and favored. He was cordially received, and after being
          shown to a seat proceeded to unfold the purpose of his visit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          of the Chosen People, even though the spirit be swallowed up by the
          letter.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Serenus, thou art a noble student, goodly in spirit
          and conduct, even though thou seemest to have but light regard for
          our traditions. I commend thee for thy good-will toward thy
          fellow-disciple, and will freely grant thy request. I am persuaded
          that I can compass his release without formal trial, for his
          transgression is of slight moment to the Romans. It was but an
          excess of youthful zeal.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus was
          about to take his leave, when Amabel hastily entered the library to
          make some slight request of her father. It was too late to retreat,
          and in the twinkling of an eye she unexpectedly found herself face
          to face with her own heroic mystery of the previous evening. The
          Rabban had a kind heart, and without hesitation presented his
          gifted pupil to his daughter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus made a
          graceful salutation, and at once recognized the radiant eyes which
          had so disconcerted him at the Lyceum. He was about to quietly
          withdraw, feeling <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page74">[pg
          74]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>that the forced introduction gave no warrant
          for conversation, when Amabel broke the silence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I was present at the debate yesterday, and much
          interested in thine argument.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ah! I recall thy face as one that I noticed in the
          gallery of the women, but was unaware that it was the daughter of
          the Rabban who thus honored me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Both thy reasoning and calm self-command were much to
          thy favor,”</span> she softly replied; and then the thought of her
          boldness disconcerted her, and brought a sudden flush of rich color
          to her cheeks.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A thought
          flashed upon Serenus, <span class="tei tei-q">“How
          beautiful!”</span> but the conversation was not further
          continued.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But immediately
          regaining his composure, he graciously thanked the Rabban and his
          daughter, and took his leave. But those large liquid eyes haunted
          him. They seemed to be the outlet for a beautiful soul which spoke
          through them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gamaliel
          repaired to the Tower of Antonia; and as no charge of violation of
          Roman law had been entered against Saulus, the Rabban’s plea that
          the offence was but a youthful misdemeanor was sufficient, and the
          young Jew was set free. He was only made aware that he received his
          liberty through the influence of Gamaliel, and at once inferred
          from this intercession that the master was willing to forgive, or
          perchance approve, his over-zealous conduct on account of his
          unwavering faithfulness to doctrine.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a light
          reprimand, he passed out from beneath the frowning battlements of
          the Tower, and returned to his lodging in the Sheepmarket. A warm
          greeting was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page75">[pg
          75]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>given by the innkeeper and his family. They
          were surprised to behold him at liberty; and Cassia was unwontedly
          joyful, but her swollen eyes gave evidence of recent weeping.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The family of
          Almon were Pharisees of the strictest sect; and the inn was the
          resort of a faction, composed of certain members of the assembly,
          of whom Saulus was the acknowledged leader and champion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My young friend,”</span> said Almon, warmly saluting
          him, <span class="tei tei-q">“how didst thou so soon loosen the
          iron grip of the Roman?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Verily, mine host Almon, the Rabban takes care of his
          own. Even the Gentile tyrant holdeth him in respect. I am persuaded
          that his immediate intercession may be a sign that the heresy of
          that apostate, Serenus, is to be overthrown.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Were the keepers at the Tower kind to thee during thy
          captivity?”</span> inquired Cassia, with deep interest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Fair Cassia, I suffered no harm at their

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Surely, thou art wearied, and must needs have rest and

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The maiden kept
          her fan in rapid motion, and nodded her satisfaction.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Cæsar hath his foot on our necks,”</span> continued
          Saulus; <span class="tei tei-q">“but the time draweth nigh when it
          will slip, and we shall arise. We are the seed of Abraham; and
          though every Roman were a Cæsar, we shall throw off our yoke. The

          throbs at the coming deliverance. By the light of Judean prophecy,
          I have a vision of the proud Roman as trodden dust.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“May the rising and setting of the sun be

          how long? The tramp of Roman legions shakes the land until it
          trembles like a threshing-floor beaten with flails! The breast of
          the Holy City is bruised with hammers until her blood flows, and
          she is covered with wounds! Our holy places are contemned, the oil
          of our anointing is wasted, and our burnt offerings are
          defiled!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is even so, O Almon; but Jehovah will spoil the
          power of Rome, and the sophistry of the Greek will be an
          abomination. The horns of the Altar will be exalted, and the
          Gentile bow to the wisdom of the Jew. But the heathen never knew
          the God of Israel, and therefore cannot forget him. Cursed, and
          thrice cursed be those who have learned the law and the prophets,
          and then turn and make light of them. Cæsar’s hordes, in their
          ignorance, pay homage to their vile divinities; but the reprobate
          Serenus and his followers befoul our traditions, and abundantly
          deserve a resting-place in the valley of Gehenna. But for the heavy
          hand of Tiberius, the Circumcision might now purify itself, and
          cast out its own dregs.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the first
          pause, the little Cassia again put in a plea.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hour was not
          yet come for the common midday repast; so Saulus followed her to

          platter upon which were some thin cakes, with honey, figs, and
          olives, and a small silver amphora of wine. She watched him with
          satisfaction while he partook of the frugal repast.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her face was

          quickening in his heart-beat, and he drew a long breath as he gazed
          upon her happy smile and dimpled cheeks. Her slight form was lithe
          and shapely; her large eyes, arched by drooping lids, downcast, and
          the full ripe lips, carelessly parted, seemed like those of a
          child. But in the soft air of Judea, and under the genial warmth of
          an Oriental sun, children, like plants, blossom early.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Saulus, thou art brave! No other man so valiantly
          defendeth the religion of our fathers. Would that I had been at the
          Lyceum to witness thy valor; for of all young Hebrews, thou art the
          most gifted.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He looked into
          her sweet, innocent face, and reverently took her hand, and pressed
          it to his lips; then quickly turning, went out, and again passed
          near the frowning Tower, upon which he cast a momentary scowl, as
          he made his way up to the assembly on Mount Moriah.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the evening
          of the same day, there was to be a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page78">[pg 78]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> This
          was a secret Pharisaic organization composed of certain pupils of
          Gamaliel. Some were regular lodgers at the inn, but the larger part
          were dwellers in other houses. Saulus had been chosen chief
          officer, and its members were his zealous partisans. Their place of
          meeting was in an upper hall in which about threescore persons
          could comfortably convene. Though in an adjoining building, it
          could only be entered from the inn of Almon. To reach it, it was
          necessary to ascend to the roof, and pass through a long covered
          passage-way, thence through a small vestibule or anteroom.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The society
          designed to give Saulus a warm and befitting reception, in
          acknowledgment of his valor shown upon the day before, and to
          becomingly celebrate the release of their leader from the hated
          Tower.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The evening
          arrived, and the gathering was of unwonted interest, and the ardor
          uncurbed. As they passed in, the members identified themselves, one
          by one, by a certain symbolic phrase and gesture, given to the
          doorkeeper; and soon the room was well filled. When all had
          assembled, the doors were barred so that there could be no
          intrusion from without.</p>

          <span style="font-size: 144%">MAGIC AND MYSTERY: STRANGE
          VISIONS</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Magic is limited
          to no race, age, or condition. Whatever the religion or ethical
          system of a people, there are—underlying and intermingled—many
          intangible and occult elements that are common to humanity. Often
          the modern world comes into recognition of some veiled principle or
          potentiality, and marks and christens it <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">de
          novo</span></span>, believing it to be an original discovery. A
          deeper investigation, however, reveals evidences of its power and
          presence, extending backward indefinitely. Both the real mysteries
          and the superstitions that prevail during successive epochs change
          their form of manifestation, but a slight excavation shows that the
          same psychical germs and roots are indigenous to every soil.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Hebrews,
          like other races, made research among all that is latent and
          mystical in nature and man. Although more has been written
          regarding the magic and occultism of the Chaldeans, Persians, and
          Greeks, yet a search in the light of the Present, through the
          ancient Hebrew writings, shows them to be crowded with accounts of
          psychical phenomena, though expressed in historic terms. These were
          counted as supernatural, which signified beyond the realm of law,
          and outside <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page80">[pg
          80]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
          the logical relation of cause and effect. This view has continued
          in large degree down to the present time. It was supposed that
          Jehovah was constantly revealing himself by special volition
          through dreams, visions, trances, voices, and signs; and spirits,
          both good and evil, are of frequent mention. Their chronological
          distance, together with a preternatural glamour which has been cast
          upon them, has caused their recorded phenomena to seem unique or
          special, rather than universal. But they are intermingled with
          every system of worship which the world has known.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even the
          revelation of the divine has come through inward states of
          consciousness rather than by outward observation. This is its
          orderly method. The mind of man is ever sounding its own hidden
          deeps, and striving to bring to light its infinite wealth of
          fundamental and occult mysteries. It instinctively feels that there
          is a divine inlet at its profound centre.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Creative art is
          ever transcending the real in its search for the coming ideal. Even
          Nature herself is subservient to the mastery of Mind. A true magic
          is divine; while its inversion and abuse,—sometimes called black
          magic,—in the very nature of things, kindles Tartarean pains and
          penalties.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Genius can never
          be satisfied with the world as it is, therefore it can and must
          make a new one. Science discovers and classifies; while art, which
          is but the name for active human imaging, is divine in that it
          creates. Next in value to a seen Utopia is one which can be
          conjured into existence, and such is awaiting every one’s
          command.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page81">[pg
          81]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But magic, as
          commonly defined, is a two-edged instrument. Misused, it becomes
          evil <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">genii</span></span>, who summon foul shapes,
          and clothe them with realism. Passions, hates, and evil imagings in
          the mist of mind sometimes become solidified embodiments that haunt
          and persecute their creators. He who peers into the raging billows
          of a disorderly imagination beholds monsters into which he has
          breathed the breath of life.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">
            &nbsp;
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The secret
          society of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Urim</span></span> had assembled, and the
          doors were closed. Their meeting-place was a remarkable occult
          study, for every decoration and furnishing possessed some mystical
          or symbolic significance. In each of the four corners, upon an
          elevated pedestal of white marble, stood a tall brass candelabrum
          of beaten work, containing seven branches upon its shaft, each
          having a lamp filled with pure olive oil for the light, with knop
          and cup fashioned like an almond-blossom. At the east end of the
          room there was a heavy table of acacia wood, the top of which was
          curiously engraved, and upon each corner was a horn of one piece
          with it. Just over its centre, and suspended from the ceiling by a
          silken cord, was a large quartzoid of transparent rock-crystal. It
          was believed that at certain seasons a steady, concentrated gaze
          into its pellucid depths would produce visions, or at least symbols
          of future events, and sometimes there was included glimpses of
          things distant. The table was enclosed by a curtain of blue, gold,
          and scarlet, held in place by ouches or sockets attached to a
          finely woven band supported by standards of beaten
          brass.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page82">[pg
          82]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the opposite
          end of the room were small wheels, cunningly devised of dark steel
          mirrors, made to revolve, section within section, mystifying and
          trance-producing in their occult power, and held to be symbolic of
          the wheels of the prophet Ezekiel. The walls and ceiling were
          bespangled with tracings, emblematic of prophecy, miracle,
          sacrifice, circumcision, and the covenants.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the centre of
          the room there was a small brazen altar, consecrated to the burning
          of stacte, onycha, frankincense, and other aromatic spices. Near
          the entrance stood a cabinet of olive-wood containing flagons and
          bowls from which wine was served, and also platters containing thin
          wheaten wafers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rites of the
          society were commonly a matter of somewhat formal routine; but on
          special occasions or anniversaries they included revels, psychic
          agitations, disorderly and ungoverned excitements, trances, and
          enchantments. At times the Jew, with all the weight of the Covenant
          upon him, gave himself up to those things which corresponded to the
          orgies of the neighboring religions. But his excesses, though
          violent, were far less gross.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the rapid
          growth of sectarian bigotry among the disciples of Gamaliel, the
          antagonism of the hyper-Pharisaic faction had become exceedingly
          bitter. This was embodied strongly in Saulus, as the natural
          leader; and his followers were wont to glorify him without bound.
          His release from the Tower through the intercession of the Rabban,
          being misunderstood, greatly emboldened them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the
          society had convened, each young Jew donned <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page83">[pg 83]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the insignia of the order, and appeared
          in his place. At a given signal, all arose, formed in procession,
          and passed slowly around the room, each in turn quaffing a small
          flagon of wine, which was the opening act of formal ceremony. After
          the last had been served, the column began a stately march around a
          large circle, which was symbolically marked upon the floor, falling
          into the rhythm of a spirited chant dedicated to their leader, in
          which all joined.</p>

          We have met to engage in the exercise of our secret rites, and also
          to honor our most worthy Dictator, Saulus. O sons of prophets! It
          belongeth to our brotherhood to establish a sovereignty among the
          disciples of Gamaliel, and to discomfit the destroyers of our
          Judean traditions, who deceitfully continue to wear our name and
          covenant. Our adversaries are near. Even the worthy Rabban scents
          not their plottings, so disguised are they with professions of
          good-will and liberality. The Roman is an open foe whose courage
          wins respect; but they who betray our doctrine, covenant, and
          circumcision are the real enemies of the Most High and of the
          Chosen People. Honor to Saulus! Guides of the Inner and Outer

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus was
          conducted with much ceremony to a seat raised upon a dais which was
          canopied with an elaborate baldachin, and which was used only upon
          rare and notable occasions. A crown of laurel was placed upon his
          head; and a dance in slow rhythm, which was emblematic of
          laudation, was performed in a circle about him. At length the
          ceremony ended, and Saulus arose and addressed a few words to his
          fellow-members.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The formal

          members of the Outer Circle then withdrew; while those of the
          Inner, among whom was Saulus, remained to seek for signs and
          wonders.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the doors
          were rebarred, a flame was lighted upon the small brazen altar, and
          aromatic spices were placed upon it for slow consumption. The
          members then seated themselves around it, with hands joined, and
          remained silent for some time, breathing in deep, concerted,
          rhythmical measure. A pungent but fascinating odor gradually filled
          the room, and a charmed exhilaration stole by degrees upon the
          minds and senses of the brotherhood of the Inner Circle. A subtle
          enchantment, delightful in quality, transported them to empyrean
          heights of consciousness, so that the every-day world of objective
          events receded and became distant and misty. They craved some
          prophetic symbolism of the future.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a short
          sitting they arose, and four of the number, Saulus being one,
          passed to the acacia table, where <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page86">[pg 86]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>they seated themselves, each grasping one of
          its horns, and turning a fixed gaze into the transparent deeps of
          the great crystal which hung in their midst. The others seated
          themselves in a semicircle facing the revolving wheel of mirrors,
          and yielded passively to such impressions as might float in upon
          them. Soon there was a change, a peculiar abstraction being
          apparent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a full hour
          a delicious ecstatic consciousness prevailed, and perfect silence
          reigned. The room seemed like a bower of roses. Fruits were heaped
          in golden baskets, and fine sprays of perfumed water from invisible
          fountains filled the air. Jasper floors stretched away in the
          distance, and upon them were spread mats of shining crystals of
          variegated hues. Life, action, color, and warmth pervaded the
          atmosphere so thickly that one could float in their shimmering
          wavelets. Reverberations of unearthly music flowed gently in, as if
          a myriad of Æolian harps were hung above, below, and on all sides,
          which were swept by heavenly breezes. The energies of Nature were
          melted into an impalpable but all-embracing voluptuous harmony.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But at length
          there were symptoms of discord, and a gradual transformation began
          to be manifest. Harshness and disorder slowly emerged in uncanny
          shapes from the dim background. The psychical intoxication which
          prevailed was perceptibly embittered, and subtle forms of
          mysterious portent crept in. The ambient air became streaked with
          dark patches which grew thicker and wider. The night-winds sprang
          up, and muffled mutterings from without were borne in with sullen
          discordance. The erstwhile film of iridescence shrivelled
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page87">[pg 87]</span><a name="Pg087"
          id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and parted, and flitting out
          from behind were grim faces of sin and crime, anon hiding behind
          clouds of blackness. The blood-streaked moon that had arisen in a
          brazen sky poured forth a flood of wan, sickly light which entered
          the casement and seemed offensive. The vapors that ascended from
          the altar were resolved into a semblance of moving figures of dark
          and gloomy mien, with hollow and gusty voices, and eyeballs which
          glowed like living coals. Suddenly a bluish flash filled the room,
          and upon the walls letters of fire were traced without the aid of
          mortal hand. Then it seemed as though the room were fissured and
          rent by a strange and resistless pressure from without. Deep,
          jarring sounds rumbled below like the mad bellowing of an unborn
          earthquake. The black shadow of a Great Hand moved slowly across
          the ceiling.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A living Shape
          emerged through the wall, and seated itself in the chair upon the
          dais which Saulus before had occupied. It was thickly veiled, and
          appeared more like some misshapen reptile than a human form. Its
          intolerable eyes looked out with an appalling stare of hate and
          mockery. It was a nameless Horror, with an aspect of deadly
          malignity, and a wreath of fire, shaped like the laurel chaplet
          that Saulus had worn, was upon its head.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A crackling
          explosion! Then passing directly through the barred door, a
          procession of foul dancing figures entered in pairs, and tripped
          lightly around the larger mystic circle which was marked upon the
          floor. Hatred <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page88">[pg
          88]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and
          Revenge led the way, each with his name in letters of flame upon
          his forehead. Treachery and Conspiracy followed, arm in arm, and
          next, Persecution and Slaughter, with a host of lesser imps
          bringing up the rear. They wheeled about, and with ever-quickening
          step, each in turn bowed to the Nameless One who occupied the chair
          upon the dais. Another blinding crash! and the whole scene was
          dissolved into the blackness of darkness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every member of
          the Inner Circle was suddenly awakened from a heavy sleep. The
          lamps had been extinguished, and the flame upon the altar had
          expired. The lights were soon rekindled, and everything was found
          as had been wont. The ashy pallor and cold perspiration which was
          upon every face gradually passed away, and courage and calmness
          resumed their sway. Each had dreamed a dream of delicious
          enchantment, followed by a visit to the Tartarean regions, but no
          two saw them quite alike.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chairman of
          the session, with a bewildered look, turned to Saulus.</p>

          perplexity passed over the face of the son of Benoni; but after a
          brief wavering he replied,—</p>

          patriarchs and prophets. The chosen and righteous call out burning
          enmity, which is made known through ghostly and malignant shapes.

          itself into our Covenant and Tradition. Brothers of the Inner
          Circle! we incarnated the spirit of prophecy, and must needs look
          upon the ghostly symbolic visions of warfare. They crowd themselves
          upon us as mystical revealers of those who wickedly betray the
          doctrine of Israel. Only by glimpses of such shades of Tophet could
          we be forewarned. They are sent to fire us with a holy zeal in
          overcoming the false-hearted. The vengeance of the God of Abraham,
          Isaac, and Jacob waxes against all who burn strange fire upon our
          sacred altars; and we must needs have signs of their abomination
          brought before our eyes.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The comrades of
          Saulus were reassured by his eloquence, and his interpretation

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus waved his

          unawares while darkness is still over the Holy City.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After further
          taking counsel together, all descended to the street, and made
          their way through a narrow lane to a place beyond Hezekiah’s Pool,
          which was near the house where Serenus lived with his mother.
          Though within the city walls, the locality was remote and lonely.
          Arming themselves with stones as they passed along, Saulus
          commanded that, when they arrived at the house, they should
          surround it and make some outcry. Serenus would then appear, when
          they could smite him, and flee in the darkness, with none to
          witness against them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He shall lick the dust like a serpent,”</span> said
          Saulus; <span class="tei tei-q">“yea, as the Lord liveth, he shall
          fall and not rise again.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All then joined
          hands in a small circle, and made a solemn vow of secrecy and
          service.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By the stones of the Holy City, we swear that the God

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unclasping
          hands, they again gathered up the stones which they had laid down
          during the ceremony, and made their way to the house.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The moon had
          gone down, and the first flush of dawn was faintly visible over the
          eastern mountains. A sullen chill pervaded the air, and the
          boundless Impalpable which surrounds the earth seemed filled with a
          life which needs not breath. Nature was in a mood of gloom and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page91">[pg 91]</span><a name="Pg091"
          id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>distemper. The very leaves of
          the trees, invisible in the darkness, rustled a chorus of Sibylline
          sighs and hisses; but the comrades heard and saw nothing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At a given
          signal an outcry was made, and Serenus looked down from a window to
          make inquiry concerning it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Straightway a
          volley of stones were hurled at him; but as it was yet dark,
          Serenus suffered no harm, though they fell thick about him. But one
          glanced, and falling, struck Saulus full in the forehead, and he
          fell down as if he had yielded up the ghost. Those who were near
          lifted him up and quickly bore him away.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Late in the
          afternoon of a warm day in early autumn, the softened glow of the
          descending sun fell into the spacious court of one of the notable
          palaces of the Holy City. In the centre, the spray from a small
          fountain curved gracefully into a quadrangular marble basin; and
          ranged immediately around it were pots, partly hidden by moist
          mosses, which contained lilies, anemonies, irises of iridescent
          hue, violets, and jasmine, all freshened by the neighboring
          dampness. The surrounding pavement was of graceful mosaic design;
          and the prevailing air of coolness, cleanliness, and repose was in
          marked contrast with the dry, brassy atmosphere outside. Porches,
          supported by slim, lightly carved columns, extended entirely around
          both stories of the court; and these, in certain parts where the
          sun’s rays might penetrate, were shaded by hanging portières woven
          of fine goat’s hair in striped design. At either end, a stairway of
          marble steps led to the upper terrace, and still another flight to
          a valve which opened upon the roof. On one side was a broad portal
          which led into a great library, where shelves and <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>drawers were filled with thousands of
          rolls of manuscripts and inscribed parchments, each neatly tied,
          labelled, and classified. The place seemed fragrant with all the
          subtile richness of Hebrew law, prophecy, and poetry, which had
          been stored up from the accumulated wisdom of a long line of
          ancient seers, sages, and poets. All the carvings, friezes, and
          appurtenances of the court were also symbolically eloquent with the
          lore of Israel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tinkling of
          the fountain sounded pleasantly to the ears of two persons that
          were comfortably seated near it, who had sought the spacious
          openness of the court in preference to the library. An earnest
          conversation was in progress. The palace was that of Gamaliel; and
          the elder of the two, a tall, dignified man, with silvered hair and
          long, flowing beard, was the noted Rabban himself. Beneath the
          folds of his turban of snowy whiteness shone out his brilliant but
          kindly eyes; and his mien, while dignified, was warm and gracious.
          The other was Serenus, and it was evident that the two were upon
          terms of free and friendly familiarity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Reverend and worthy master! I count myself happy to

          of prophecy and a new dispensation of righteousness?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus paused
          for a moment before making answer, for something seemed to stir him
          from the depths of his soul. He looked gravely but tenderly into
          the face of his master. He felt that a great crisis in his own life
          had come, which could not longer be put off. The accumulated forces
          of years, long pent up, had gradually gathered momentum until they
          must find utterance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wise and
          venerable Gamaliel was astounded at the gravity and earnestness of
          his favorite assistant in making an inquiry which seemed of such
          trivial importance. He toyed with the long fringe of his robe for a
          moment, and cast an inquiring glance into the face of Serenus as if
          to divine his meaning. It hardly occurred to him that his most
          eminent follower, aforetime promoted to be his assistant, could
          have any sympathy, or even remote interest, in the feeble faction
          of the Galilean; but the question demanded an answer.</p>

          "tei tei-q">“My young disciple! Thy question is of small concern to
          me, neither doth it matter to thee. Thou shouldst be aware that
          while I counted the Nazarene to be a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a>deceiver, I would that he had not been evil
          entreated and put to death. Peradventure he was self-deceived; but
          however that may be, had he been let alone, his works would have
          come to an end, and his followers become scattered. But what have
          we to do with him? It is all of the past and concerneth us
          not.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I give honor unto thy wisdom, O learned master! but I
          am persuaded that the Nazarene was a righteous man and a great
          prophet; yea, such as the world hath not known. Thou knowest that I
          was born a Jew, and have respect unto the fulfilling of the law;
          but the doctrines of the Pharisees have become vain, and I can no
          longer bear their burden. The commandment of God hath given place
          to the traditions of men. The faith of our father Abraham, the
          testimonies of Moses, and the words of the holy prophets, have
          become of none effect; for this generation hath given itself over
          to washings of cups and pots and brazen vessels, to fastings and
          ceremonial oblations. Behold, the letter of the law hath altogether
          brought its life to destruction!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          doctrine of the Nazarene? I am somewhat like-minded with thee
          concerning the traditions of this generation. The dead observances
          of the extreme sect of the Pharisees have become an occasion of
          vanity, and a stumbling-block, and must needs be purified. Let us
          set about to reprove these things, and teach a restitution of the
          Law as handed down to Moses. But I beseech thee! go not after this
          new sect of strange faith, for its teaching will surely come to
          naught.”</span></p>

          come more and more to me that our holy religion is corrupted and
          wormeaten, and that it altogether concerneth itself with polishing
          the outside of the platter. It is a valley of dry bones, like that
          spoken of by Ezekiel the prophet, and only an anointing of the
          Spirit, which hath been so perfectly manifested through Jesus of
          Nazareth, can awaken them to life, and clothe them with

          thou wilt cut thyself off from thy people, and from thy place of
          honor in the school of the prophets. The Nazarene, of whom thou
          speakest, was reputed to be an unlearned man, the son of a
          carpenter! If he had knowledge, whence came it? If I have learned
          rightly, he even vaunted himself as the Lord’s anointed, the
          fulfiller of prophecy, and the deliverer of Israel! What empty

          ancient prophets. I call thee to witness! What saith Isaiah, the
          son of Amoz, than whom there hath not been a greater? Doth he not
          prophesy of humility, and reproach, and travail, and persecution?
          Nay! Saith he not that his righteous servant shall pour out his
          soul unto death? Hath it not now come to pass that he was despised
          and rejected of men, and that his report hath not been believed?

          drinking up the morning dew which rested lightly upon the reeds,
          grasses, and climbing vines that thinly fringed the steeps and
          cliffs of the hill-country of Mount Ephraim, a little to the
          northwest of Jerusalem. Through this broken district, the road
          which led from the seaport of Cæsarea to the Holy City wound along
          near the bottom of a shallow wady, and ere long between scarred
          bluffs through a long, irregular valley, and then ascended, leading
          over a considerable elevation before passing through the Mount
          Ephraim gate into the city.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these early
          morning hours, a small caravan might be seen, winding along the
          beaten track in slow, serpentine fashion. It was composed of a few
          well-laden camels and asses, accompanied by men, women, and
          children, who, having just struck their tents, were now nearing the
          end of their journey. An eager air of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          in the little company; and the brightness of the morning, and the
          near approach to the Capital, infused every one with new life, in
          view of what was soon to open to their vision.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What a tale this
          road might unfold of the various companies of pilgrims, princes,
          captains, and panoplied armies, which, before and since, have trod
          its tortuous windings! What victories and defeats, what surprises
          and disappointments, what inspiration and suffering! What vain
          hopes destroyed and heroism rewarded! What eruptions of invaders,
          who at intervals have despoiled the ancient city,—Chaldeans,
          Assyrians, Romans, and later the great armies of Rome under Titus;
          and long afterwards, Turks and crusaders, like great tidal waves,
          have surged through this and the other beaten highways that
          converge in the city of Mount Zion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the little
          procession were some who for the first time were to have a vision
          of the Temple, the city’s long, curving, battlemented walls, its
          proud palaces, its frowning towers, its graceful cenotaphs and
          pillared courts, and others to whose eyes all these were familiar.
          Within two or three furlongs of the city wall on the northwest, the
          road passes over a considerable elevation, from which Jerusalem
          lies spread out upon its native hills, with the bluish-purple
          slopes of the Mount of Olives in the background to the southeast.
          On this high ground the road skirted a large open garden, or park,
          that sloped toward the city, which contained seats, arbors,
          flowers, and shrubbery, the whole forming a <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>place of public resort. Interspersed by
          small trees, and shaded by bushes and vines, were a series of
          graded terraces, each of which commanded a fine view of the city.
          It was a favorite resort in the milder seasons of the year.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The caravan
          passed on through the gateway into the city; but a young man,
          somewhat below medium size, with strongly marked Jewish features,
          left it, and turning to the right, entered the garden to enjoy the
          prospect, and call up a few reminiscences before the final
          completion of his journey.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was no other
          than Saulus!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After an absence
          of a few years in his native city, he was again near the scene of
          his more youthful education and adventures. The sun was already
          warm; and, wiping the perspiration from his forehead, he sat down
          in a small arbor, which was covered overhead, and partly sheltered
          before and behind by hedges and hanging vines. The fragrance of
          many blossoms loaded the morning air, and the cheery song of birds
          echoed from the trees far and near.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Saulus looked
          out over the familiar landmarks of the city, his bosom heaved, his
          cheeks reddened, and his eyes dilated at the panorama that was
          again unrolled before him. His thoughts ran quickly back over the
          long history of the Chosen People, their many trials and conquests,
          their glory and their captivity. There was much to inspire, but
          more to sadden. What a history of numberless vicissitudes was
          written in stone, masonry, and marble! How many conflicts,
          successes, and disasters were wrapped up in the mas<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sive city wall built by good King
          Hezekiah! What a long line of events were cast into the haughty
          Towers of Hippicus, Phasælus, and Mariamne, whose proud heads
          lifted themselves high into the air directly to the southward!
          Still beyond, in the same direction, the royal hill of Mount Zion
          was crowned by the great Herodian palace. What a long line of
          fragrant memories of patriarchs and judges, of anointed kings,
          including David and Solomon, covering many bright days of Hebrew
          history, were there solidified into visible form! Upon the same
          historic site stood the house of Caiaphas, the Roman prætorium, and
          the great central synagogue.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Was the time
          coming when the proud Roman would be thrust out, and Jewish
          dominion again centre with undimmed lustre upon these consecrated
          heights? How long, oh, how long! before the God of Israel would
          rally and inspire the multitudes of his people, bring back his
          scattered captives, and lead them forth, a conquering host?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Farther to the
          east, and directly above the great massive Tower of Antonia,—which
          Saulus recognized with a frown,—the sacred Temple-crowned summit of
          Moriah caused a throb of rejoicing and patriotic pride. His eye
          rested with satisfaction upon the great pile of snowy whiteness,
          founded by Solomon, and rebuilt by Herod, with its long lines of
          marble pillars, gates of Corinthian brass, and numerous towers and
          pinnacles overlaid with silver and gold. How many courts, each
          encircling others within, lifted themselves, tier above tier, to
          the Tabernacle and Holy of Holies, which formed the sacred
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name=
          "Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>centre from which
          Jehovah radiated his glory in a special and peculiar manner.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sun ascended
          higher, and the whole scene melted into a dream of shimmering
          whiteness and beauty. What an attraction and inspiration to every
          Jew in all ages! Fitting type to him of all that is patriotic,
          glorious, and heavenly! The soft green western slopes of Olivet
          formed a peaceful and refreshing background to the busy haunts of
          men.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such were some
          of the thoughts that passed in a trooping procession through the
          mind of Saulus; and now, what of the present and future? What of
          his own duties, hopes, dreams, and ambitions? What of the new
          heretical sect, whose overthrow was to be his especial business and
          gratification? What of the Rabban, his former companions, Serenus,
          the people at the inn? Last, but far, oh, far from least, what of
          Cassia?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Cassia! little one! Will thy heart beat quickly, thy
          cheeks flush, and thine eyes glisten at my coming? Hast thou dreams
          of my arrival, and hath absence endeared me to thee? Hast thou
          often thought of him to whom thou so faithfully and tenderly
          ministered? Thy messages seem not to have been so warm and frequent
          of late. Surely thou hast not lost the image of Saulus from thy
          heart?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young man
          was suddenly aroused from his prolonged revery by the approach of a
          party of men, women, and children from the city. Some were laden
          with small baskets and wallets containing wheaten wafers, and
          others carried fruits, and skins of wine. It was a pleasure
          excursion of Hebrew families for relaxation and <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>enjoyment. They distributed themselves
          promiscuously in groups among the shady and secluded seats and
          arbors, dispersing in little parties, often of two or three, in the
          most informal manner.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Almost before
          Saulus was aware of it, a young man and woman had seated themselves
          immediately in front, their backs almost hidden by a light hedge
          which was covered by running vines. Their seats were very near. His
          first impulse was to retire, but that was impossible without
          observation; and during a moment’s hesitation he heard something of
          remarkable interest. A word distinctly uttered chained him to the
          spot. His position was such that he plainly saw the backs of the
          young pair, just in front and below him, through the interstices of
          the hedge, while he was entirely concealed. He was no eavesdropper,
          but fate transfixed him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          sayest thou? Shall we not sit down and enjoy the prospect? Our

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          our dreams of the future are <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          our gaze, day by day, the things we shape in our own minds really
          come about, and more, that we unconsciously grow into their image.
          In other words, they take such hold that we are slowly transformed
          by them.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She again turned
          a searching glance toward his face, but his gaze was still fastened
          upon the mountain landscape.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Peradventure yea, and peradventure nay,”</span> she
          replied, with a light flush; <span class="tei tei-q">“but please
          proceed.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Barnabas bade
          adieu to the distant mountain, and with some vigor of manner turned
          his face toward the maiden as if to read her thoughts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The figure just
          beyond the hedge gave such a start that only the vital interest of
          the twain in the topic of their conversation prevented a
          discovery.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Little Cassia,
          who was not greatly disconcerted, pouted her lips a bit, toyed with

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a
          slight tinge of cheery, though defiant, sarcasm in her tone, and
          the flush on her cheek had heightened. Then a little period of
          silence followed, during which Barnabas again gave himself to the
          mountain. On the other side of the thin hedge a heart was beating
          so loudly that its throbs were almost audible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length
          Barnabas turned, and gently picked up the little hand which was
          temptingly near, and raising it, touched it to his lips, and as
          reverently lowered it, after which it was slowly withdrawn.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          and this, with a sudden shaking of the hedge, startled the twain,
          when, at a glance, feeling the presence of a stranger near, they
          turned quickly down the nearest pathway, and rejoined their
          friends. The stranger, who was a stranger still to them, was left

          deepened, and were fast chasing away the brightness which had
          streamed down from above, in the luxurious court of the palace of
          Gamaliel. The interview between the Rabban and his disciple was at
          an end, and their long-standing relation fully and finally severed.
          Neither evinced any disposition to reconsider the decision, or

          arisen from his seat to take leave of his esteemed teacher and
          master. The young man’s bearing, while calm and dignified,
          betokened a warmth of affection which was deep and sincere. Strong
          ties were being severed; but, in the nature of the case, there was
          no alternative. But the perfect serenity and uncomplaining spirit
          shown by the young man at their parting touched a tender chord in
          the heart of Gamaliel. His <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          way to the apartment where the simple evening meal was served; and
          Serenus was greeted by Amabel and her mother, with whom he was on
          friendly and familiar terms. Mutual esteem and previous visits had
          inspired such confidence as might have been bestowed upon one of
          the family. Serenus and Amabel were warm friends, but up to the
          present time no word beyond the boundary of simple friendship had
          ever passed between them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the meal
          was ended, Gamaliel withdrew briefly, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          the evening was sultry, the others repaired to the house-top, where
          the Rabban would erelong rejoin them. But soon the mother was also
          summoned away; and kind, or unkind, fate, through fortuitous
          combination, left Serenus and Amabel by themselves. An easy seat,
          sheltered by a light canopy, which was close by the parapet on the
          side overlooking the city, invited their occupancy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sun long
          before had hid himself behind the Mount Ephraim Range in the west;
          and darkness crept up from the valleys, and was fast blotting out
          the tinting and burnishing that had softly rested upon battlements
          and towers, and the neighboring slopes of Olivet. One by one the
          city lamps, like fire-flies, twinkled in the growing gloom, and the
          starry heaven above solemnly marshalled its host, while the cheeks
          of the young pair were fanned by the balmy evening breeze.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amabel had great
          respect for the courage and sincerity of Serenus; but far more than
          that, his image was deeply engraven upon her heart. But still,
          after this long time, she felt unready to make the confession, even
          to herself. As for Serenus, he long had lived among visions, and
          alternated between hopes and fears. There had steadily gleamed in
          his soul love for Amabel, and at times ecstasy beyond limit. Of her
          warm friendship he had no doubt, but of more he was not sure. Who
          shall interpret human hearts to each other?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Serenus had
          long indulged the delightful dream which was constantly before him.
          The beauty and purity of Amabel made her seem almost like a
          divinity, worthy of any sacrifice and devotion, if not actual
          hom<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name=
          "Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>age. But now, knowing
          her devoted loyalty to her church and race, what hope could remain
          for him? Deprived of his position by his own irrevocable choice,
          and soon to be misunderstood and counted as disloyal to the
          interests of the Chosen People, he had virtually dashed the cup of
          bliss from his own lips. Was he not mad in his devotion to a
          principle, which would not only cost place and reputation, but also
          wreck his long-nourished hopes regarding Amabel? Such were a few of
          the thoughts that rushed in a quick procession through his mind, as
          he was thrown for a brief period into the charmed presence. On her
          part there was an unwonted reserve. She seemed to feel the approach
          of a crisis in her life. The deepening shadows veiled her beautiful
          features, but the large lustrous eyes almost shone through the
          blackness in soulful radiation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The darkness which from without falls upon us is a
          fitting symbol of that which steals about my heart,”</span> said
          Serenus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Why art thou so cast down, O Serenus?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I would fain answer thy question and open my soul to
          thee, fair one; but a great trial is laid upon me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Peradventure I might help thee to bear it.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gloom hid
          the expression of intense interest which played upon her face as
          she had spoken. Serenus was also like a bow bent to the
          breaking-point.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sweet Amabel! long have I loved thee! From the time
          when at the Lyceum thy speaking eyes thrilled me, thy charming soul

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again the
          friendly shades of evening veiled the rich flush which mantled the
          cheeks of the Jewish maiden. She was stirred to the depths of her
          being, but waited to hear more. Serenus continued,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thou wouldst inquire concerning the trial? Can

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I accept as true the
          message of the prophet of Nazareth, whom our own Chosen People
          counted as a blasphemer, and have crucified!</span></span> He was
          innocent, just, and holy! His life was pure, and his love went out
          to all—even his persecutors. He lived the full divine pattern for
          both Jew and Gentile. His kingdom is an unseen kingdom, and cometh
          not with observation. He came not as an earthly conqueror, to throw
          off the Roman yoke by force, but to show men how to unloose the
          heavier yoke of spiritual bondage, carnality, and dead works. There
          is a light which is in every man, but only the Man <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jesus</span></span>
          hath perfected it in seen demonstration and expression. Through the
          power of the Father, to which he opened himself, he healed the
          sick, cleansed the leper, raised the fallen, and saved the sinful,
          and proclaimed that all these works are possible to all who are
          filled with the same spirit. He hath departed bodily; but the
          fulness of life which he showed forth is ever in the world, waiting
          for manifestation. The outer tumult of our lives may be so hushed
          that we can hear the voice of Truth in the stillness within. True
          religion is comprehended in oneness with the Father, and not in
          ceremonies and ordinances.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus poured
          out these thoughts as though they had <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>been burning within him for utterance. After a
          moment’s pause he continued,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“This is a new faith, howbeit it hath long had some
          growth within me. Yea, before the advent of the Nazarene I felt
          somewhat of its spirit moving in my heart. I have made all these
          things known to thy worthy father. My reputation and honor among
          our people is gone, and my work in the Assembly of the Wise ended!
          When these things that I have spoken unto thee reach the ears of
          the scribes and elders, I shall be a reproach; yea, persecution may
          be meted out to me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The soul of
          Amabel was wrung with agony as he continued,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold my trial! O fair daughter of Gamaliel, I am
          persuaded of thy loving and pure loyalty to thy father, thy
          religion, and thy people! I know my burden, and must bear it, even
          though it crush me! I go out from thy father’s house, and will see
          thee no more.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Serenus, I know well thy noble spirit! Must these
          things be?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus sat with
          bowed head, and made no answer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amabel was a
          loving and dutiful daughter of a tender father. But with all his
          kindness, she well knew his firmness, and had no thought of putting
          it to the test, or raising any question. Her whole training and
          life had been devoted and consecrated to the religion of her
          people. While not bigoted or exclusive, she was thoroughly sincere
          in every service. She also fully divined both the firmness and
          sincerity of Serenus. She knew that his impassioned utterances
          about the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg
          127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>new religion welled up from the depths of his
          soul, and saw how dearly they cost him. A great rock had suddenly
          been rolled across her pathway, and there was no way around it.
          Silently holding herself, and shrouded by the prevailing obscurity,
          the great hot tears fell thick and fast.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-lg" style=
          "margin-left: 2.00em; margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The moments flew
          swiftly by. Amabel must be loyal, and she would be brave. She must
          hide her love, even because of it. If Serenus knew of it, would it
          not double the bitterness of his own cup? Can love suppress itself
          in behalf of its own object? Yea, it will suffer all things.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Serenus! think no more of me! Thou art a noble
          spirit, but pray let thy dreams of our future come to an end. There
          is a great gulf between us, which love, even if it possessed me,
          could not span. It will be for thy peace if our paths come no more
          together.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was
          another silence of several moments, during which the heart-throbs
          of each were almost audible, but no other word could be added. The
          very palace beneath them was no more immovable than the fate which
          destiny decreed, both by and for them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus found
          the great question echoing through the recesses of his heart, as to
          the real feeling of Amabel toward him; but there was no solution,
          and he even recognized that it were better so. What mattered it, so
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name=
          "Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>long as the gulf that
          yawned between them was impassable!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The silence was
          soon broken by the return of the Rabban, who resumed the
          conversation that had been interrupted. But he little dreamed what
          a tension was upon the two young souls.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus soon
          took his leave, passed out of the palace, and started down the
          northerly descent of Mount Zion in the direction of his quiet home,
          which was some distance to the north-west, beyond Hezekiah’s Pool.
          But before he had come to the end of the sloping palace gardens, he
          saw some deserted seats among the scattered shrubbery upon one of
          the terraces, and attracted by the balminess of the evening, sat
          down. The opportunity for silent meditation and composure after the
          trying ordeal through which he had passed was very welcome. He
          would take his bearings anew, and sound the subtle recesses of his
          sorrows and experiences, and confirm and re-interpret his hopes and
          aspirations. At length he looked up into the starry canopy above,
          and entered into communion with the Universal, and his fevered
          pulse grew calm. He relaxed the soul-tension which had been upon
          him, and consciously opened his being to the eternal and
          all-prevailing Love and Goodness, and peace, like a river, flowed
          in. He was conscious of an universal reconciliation with all
          things, past, present, and future. The unbounded benediction which
          overwhelmed him submerged all that had been local, temporary, and
          disquieting. His soul expanded, and he was conscious of an
          at-one-ment with the whole order of Nature. It was all in, of, and
          for him. What, after <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg
          129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>all, was the sweetness of the purest and most
          beautiful personal affection but a rudimentary lesson, a detached
          gleam, from the wide radiance of the unbounded sunlight! His love
          for Amabel was like a little purling rill, finding its way to the
          ocean, not to be destroyed, but enfolded in an infinitely Greater.
          It must become multiplied, until Amabel is in all people, Jew and
          Gentile, Greek and barbarian. If her form be no more beheld, she
          shall be an universal interpreter. She is everywhere, even though
          unseen. Pierce through the rough outer coverings of all souls, and
          the divine germ of Love is there, only waiting for the light and
          moisture of consciousness so that it may swell and spring forth.
          Amabel is in the whispering of the breeze, the glow of the
          sunlight, the shimmer of the wave, the sighing of the forest, and
          the patter of the rain-drop. Divine Love at first can be
          interpreted only through its personified sample, which kindles the
          beginning of a flame in the human soul.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus lingered
          long enough to make the world over for himself through the choice
          of an ideal standpoint. He had learned the secret of spiritual
          alchemy, so that the Universal was mirrored within him. His spirit
          enlarged to make room for a mighty influx of love, peace, and power
          which were borne in upon him. With soul calmed and filled with
          spiritual might he arose, and with light heart and elastic step
          started toward his destination. Passing through a long, narrow
          street just to the north of the tall cenotaph of Mariamne, and
          leaving the square of the Sheepmarket a little to the east, he
          continued towards home. It was midnight, and the streets and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name=
          "Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>lanes were lonely and
          nearly deserted. But as he came near a small secluded open court by
          the side of a wine-shop, he heard a confusion of voices. He hurried
          his pace, and coming nearer discerned a prostrate form surrounded
          by four or five turbulent fellows, who were searching the garments
          of their victim for valuables. He sprang into their midst; and the
          onslaught was so sudden that the men, thinking that one of the
          Roman guard was at hand, scattered and ran in different directions.
          They already had secured all the booty they could find, and had no
          disposition to return.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus gently
          moved the body to a more secure spot not far away, and removing his
          own tunic, folded it, and placed it under the head of the wounded
          man. Espying a legionary guard in the distance, who carried a
          torch, he called to him, and reported the robbery. They carefully
          examined the man, but found no wound. He was a Jew of small
          stature, delicate and deathly pale, and, except a hurried gasping
          for breath, entirely motionless. Everything indicated that he had
          fainted in the street, and that the young barbarians, finding him
          in that helpless condition, had taken occasion to rob him. His eyes
          were closed, but soon there was a little more evidence of
          animation. At length he began to mutter incoherently, as if
          dreaming. Serenus loosened his neck-cloth, chafed his limbs, and
          stroked back his dishevelled locks, and behold, the face had a
          familiar look. The muttering continued, and became more
          audible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Cassia! <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          Cassia!</span></span> Oh! Oh!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus knew
          nothing of <span class="tei tei-q">“Cassia;”</span> but a quick
          vision of the past flashed before him, and he beheld a face
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name=
          "Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to which the
          colorless features bore a striking resemblance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Saulus! Yea, it is Saulus! My old comrade of the
          Assembly and the Lyceum!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was known to
          Serenus that Saulus had lodged aforetime at the inn of the
          Sheepmarket; and as it was not far away, he and the legionary
          tenderly bore him thither. They knocked at the outer portal; but as
          it was far into the night, all were sleeping. But continuing, Almon
          at length made his appearance, and after explanation admitted them.
          Saulus had become more quiet, but was still unconscious. When he
          had been carefully placed upon a soft couch, the Roman
          departed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O my dear friend Saulus!”</span> said Almon
          sorrowfully; <span class="tei tei-q">“thou hast nearly perished! O
          Saulus! Saulus!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He started to
          arouse his wife and Cassia; but Serenus advised that they be not
          disturbed, but that he himself be permitted to minister to the
          unconscious Saulus for a little time before taking his
          departure.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was
          something so reassuring and commanding in the mien of Serenus that
          the innkeeper consented without a question.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“With the rising of the sun, behold thou shalt see him
          entirely whole!”</span> exclaimed Serenus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Almon was then
          beckoned to stillness; and he seated himself at a little distance,
          and looked on with astonishment. Serenus gently took the hands of
          Saulus in his own, and seating himself, rested his calm gaze upon
          the pale face before him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The room was
          filled with a mysterious stillness, and there was a feeling as of a
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Presence</span></span>. To Almon there
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name=
          "Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>seemed to be an added
          surrounding brightness, and he was filled with a holy awe which he
          could not understand. Then he thought he heard the stranger whisper
          a benediction. Soon Saulus wearily opened his eyes and looked about
          him, but failed to recognize his surroundings. There was another
          profound silence, and another benediction in soft but now audible
          tones.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the sick
          man gaped twice, turned upon his side, and sank into a sweet,

          and refreshing sleep. Almon marvelled. Serenus arose to take his
          departure, only saying,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was but two
          days to the great Jewish festival of Pentecost, and Jerusalem was
          already thronged with pilgrims. They came pouring in through all
          the great thoroughfares,—from Damascus to the northward, which
          entered near Golgotha; from the seaports to the west and northwest,
          through the defiles of the hill-country of Mount Ephraim, and from
          the south, approaching through the valley of Kedron; also along the
          lesser byways—a great host. They journeyed in families, parties,
          and festal bands, singing songs and praises, and bringing
          offerings. The air was stirred with a thrill of national pride and
          exaltation. Even the great overshadowing cloud of the Roman
          dominion could not dampen the ardor nor repress the spirit of the
          harvest festival commonly known as the Feast of Weeks.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Hebrew had
          an unbounded faith in the future and permanent redemption of the
          Lord’s people, and his ideal of restoration and final triumph was
          ever before him. However galling the shackles, their loosening had
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name=
          "Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>been decreed, and was
          expected. Even the pilgrims of the more distant countries of the
          Dispersion were in no wise behind in their ardor as they gathered
          at the sacred city, <span class="tei tei-q">“whither the tribes go
          up.”</span> Each loyal heart swelled with pride as the great Temple
          came into view, where the God of Israel found his special
          dwelling-place in the Holy of Holies, from which he radiated his
          glory.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the great
          Hebrew festivals every son of Israel who lived in the Holy City
          hospitably opened his house to the pilgrims; and as the climate was
          warm during the month Sivan, thousands slept upon roofs, and also
          encamped in and around the city. Many pitched tents within the
          limits of a <span class="tei tei-q">“Sabbath day’s journey”</span>
          outside the walls.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the great
          throng was a little party of four from the distant seaport of
          Tarsus. The aged priest Abdiel, with Benoni and his wife and
          Rebecca, came not only to attend the festival, but for a longer
          sojourn. Their arrival was a few days later than that of Saulus, he
          having been charged to make provision for their necessities. They
          were to abide at the Sheepmarket.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The little
          Tarsian group approached by the road from Cæsarea, and coming upon
          the elevation beyond the walls to the northwest, beheld the City of
          David spread out before them. The roof of the Temple, which crowned
          Moriah, overlaid with beaten gold, glittered in the warm Judean
          sunshine; and as the eyes of Abdiel rested upon it, he fell on his
          knees, and stretched out his hands toward heaven.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The God of Israel be praised! Long aforetime the eyes

          Earth is spread before me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He then arose,
          and looking up to heaven, repeated from the Psalms of David,—</p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He ceased, and
          again fastened his gaze upon the Holy Hill. But anon a tremor shook
          his frame, his eyes became fixed, and he was as one in a deep
          trance. His countenance changed, his lips seemed moved by some
          mysterious power, and a message which was like a prophecy came out
          of his mouth. Even the voice was not that of Abdiel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold, little ones are born already whose eyes shall
          see Jerusalem as a heap of ruins. Sons of Israel will arise against
          each other, and strife and famine among thy people ravage thee
          within, while Roman cohorts invest thee from without. Battering
          rams will cause thy bulwarks to crumble; thy palaces shall be
          sacked, thy towers crushed, and thy Temple destroyed by fire.
          Pestilence, famine, and war shall bring thee to utter desolation,
          until thou lie in heaps. Thy glory shall vanish, thy name become a
          reproach and a hissing, and the Gentiles shall level thy ruins and
          dwell upon them.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again the frame
          of Abdiel was shaken, and he came to himself.</p><span class=

          <div class="tei tei-tb">
            &nbsp;
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day of the
          great and most joyous of the Jewish festivals opened bright but
          sultry. The early morning sun was pouring his warm beams over Mount
          Olivet, and gilding tower and roof, as Serenus wended his way
          toward a large upper chamber which was just below the westerly
          slope of the Holy Hill. This was where the disciples of the prophet
          of Nazareth were wont to gather, day by day, before the third hour.
          It was his first visit, and he was unknown to the followers of the
          Nazarene. From his youth in Alexandria, where he had been
          instructed by the great teacher Philo, he had been free in spirit
          from the traditions of the elders. He had learned somewhat of the
          Greek philosophy, and also dwelt for a season among the devoted
          Jewish sects of the Essenes and Therapeutæ. Being of a singularly
          pure and religious nature, he found the best in each, and attained
          to much wisdom and discernment, even before he came to Jerusalem.
          While a Jew by birth, and yet an observer of the more simple forms
          of the Hebrew worship, he had <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>gradually found them burdensome, until his
          free declarations concerning the Spirit of Truth made it expedient
          even for the tolerant Gamaliel to part with him. He had long
          accounted the kingdom of God as a spiritual kingdom, having no
          connection with the government of the Jewish nation. He felt that
          its seat was within, and that its coming would be without
          observation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus had
          lived the Sermon on the Mount before its audible delivery. During
          the public life and ministry of Jesus of Nazareth, he had continued
          with Gamaliel, but had watched intently the spirit and teaching of
          the newly arisen prophet. While not aforetime casting in his lot
          with his immediate followers, he was in perfect accord with his
          work and mission. Day by day he had lived in the hope that the
          sonship which had expression in the great prophet might find
          knowledge and favor of the Rabbis and all the people. His own life
          and teaching with Gamaliel were to the end of the hastening of
          peace and righteousness, and the reign on earth of love and good
          will. Before the Nazarene had appeared, he felt within himself the
          eternal Christly spirit, or that divine mind and will which was so
          soon to have new and perfected incarnation. But when the scribes
          and elders persecuted and slew the Man in whom the Word was
          articulated, he must needs forego all conformity to them, avow the
          Truth, and peradventure suffer persecution himself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus found
          the large upper chamber well filled, and those who had gathered
          were speaking words of gladness and praise. Their faces shone with
          the spirit of love, and there was perfect accord and unity. Men and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name=
          "Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>women prophesied,
          each one as moved by inspiration; and there were also times of
          silence, when all were possessed with a spiritual ecstasy which no
          tongue could interpret. All were stirred to open themselves to the
          Holy Spirit, and it filled and overflowed them. Love was so
          eloquent in every countenance that all, whatever their native
          language, heard and understood its voice in their own souls. Each
          one praised and magnified God for his heavenly vision, and all felt
          that these were the first fruits of a new spiritual dominion. Every
          one offered his unbounded service to his neighbor, and mighty works
          of ministry and healing attested the power of the spirit which was
          in them. Their joy knew no measure. Those who had been slow of
          speech waxed eloquent, the weak grew strong, the fearful became
          bold, and the unlearned spoke words of wisdom. Serenus marvelled
          and rejoiced as he heard their utterances.</p>

          perceived that nearly all who had gathered were unlearned, and of
          no reputation; such as had contempt of the Pharisees and doctors of
          the Law. Whence this wonderful wisdom! Oh, joyful demonstration!

          yourselves to it. Behold God hath not changed, for he hath
          everlasting perfection, and abideth everywhere. He is not like unto
          men, giving or withholding his favor by times and seasons, but is
          everlasting fulness, now and through all time, to all who discover
          him and find his kingdom within. Behold the same mind which filled
          the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name=
          "Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Nazarene to the
          uttermost dwelleth unmanifested in all; but they wot not of its
          presence, for they look without, expecting it to come with
          observation. While Jesus was with you after the flesh, behold your
          eyes were holden by his bodily presence, but now ye see how the
          Spirit of the Messiah aboundeth unto all. God dwelleth not in
          oblations and circumcisions and ordinances, nay, even not in yonder
          Temple more than in all the earth, for his presence is everywhere.
          Behold, whether Jew or Gentile, Parthian, Mede, or Elamite, be ye
          renewed in the inner man, for there is where God speaketh. As ye
          put on the Christly mind, which was incarnated in Jesus, ye have
          salvation within you. His blood, being interpreted, betokens his
          inmost eternal quality; and this is Spirit, and this is life. Till
          now ye knew not that ye had Christ in you, waiting for your
          outworking. But now ye have opened your vision, and therefore
          abound in faith, and show forth God’s power as it becometh his
          children. I salute every one of you in love.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Serenus
          concluded, many gathered about him, and grasped him by the hand,
          and blessed and saluted him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The news of the
          unwonted fervor of the assembly soon became noised abroad; and many
          who were curious hastily gathered, and marvelled at what they saw.
          Many false reports went out concerning it, until one Peter, a
          disciple, formerly weak, but now of great boldness, lifted up his
          voice and made explanation, showing that according to prophecy all
          these things should come to pass.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After Serenus
          went out, he joined the great throng, and went up to the Jewish
          Pentecost at the Temple. He desired once more to behold the great
          national fes<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg
          141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>tival of his own people, to which the pilgrims
          from all the scattered tribes had come up.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tramp of a
          multitude of feet resounded through the outer courts. The strange
          costumes of Jews and proselytes from Mesopotamia and Cappadocia,
          from Pontus, Egypt, and Arabia, mingled in picturesque color and
          design with the less conspicuous habiliments of the denizens of the
          Holy City. There was a great confusion of tongues and dialects, and
          the tables of the money-changers were loaded with piles of strange
          coins from many countries. The dues of the Temple, and the price of
          lambs, goats, and bullocks, must needs be paid for in the sacred
          money of Judea. There were great pens containing lambs of the first
          year, selected by the priests as being without blemish, and rams
          and he-goats, approved as sound, to be sold for sacrifices, the
          large profit going to the priests, as pertaining to their office.
          The bleating and lowing of the herds that were crowded into the
          great Temple market—soon to suffer religious martyrdom—was mingled
          with the vast babel of other sounds and voices. The marble pavement
          was littered with refuse, and would soon be stained with blood,
          poured out by the priests in conformity to the ceremonial law. The
          blare of silver trumpets, and the reverberation of patriotic and
          religious anthems, which were sung as ordained by the Levites, also
          formed a part of the great chorus. All the broad spaces on Mount
          Moriah swarmed with humanity, and the sweltering, brassy air
          vibrated with clamor and motion. The Gate Beautiful, which led from
          the court of the Gentiles to that of the Women, was flung wide
          open, and its fair proportions awakened the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pride of every Hebrew. Farther on, and
          leading into the court of Israel, was the still more celebrated
          Gate of Nicanor, made of polished Corinthian brass, which was so
          brilliant in the bright sunshine as to dazzle every beholder.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length the
          ceremonies began. The priests, dressed in long white robes, moved
          with unsandalled feet to and fro in long processions with military
          precision, and finally ranged themselves in a great semicircle,
          each with two leavened loaves and a peace offering, and waved them
          before the Lord. The animals were slain in great numbers, and
          placed upon the altars for the appointed sacrifices, the fires were
          lighted, and the smoke of incense ascended toward heaven, until the
          fierce rays of the sun were almost shut out by the great cloud that
          hung over the Holy Hill. At length the silver trumpets blew a great
          blast as a signal for silence. The High Priest, flanked by his
          subordinates, advanced upon an elevated gallery in the sight of the
          vast multitude, stretched forth his hands toward heaven with
          fingers mystically dispread, and blessed the people in the name of
          the God of Israel. The heart of every Hebrew swelled with pride as
          the great festal service was celebrated, and even Roman centurions
          looked on with interest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus was
          deeply moved as he silently viewed the mighty concourse, and
          witnessed the elaborate ritual which in the past concerned him, and
          had been wrapped about his whole life. He then thanked God that the
          fetters which had held him even lightly were now broken, and that
          the light of truth had shone into his soul, and destroyed a yoke of
          bondage which long had been galling.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus secured
          a position somewhat elevated above the heads of the people, just
          inside of the Beautiful Gate; and from it he made a wide survey of
          the imposing ceremonies of the Feast of Weeks. He marvelled how
          this favored people, the descendants of Abraham and possessors of a
          rich spiritual heritage, had disregarded the warnings of old, and
          permitted their worship to degenerate into outward legality and
          form. The simple ordinances, which once were only the tokens of a
          pure inner faith, had become an unceasing round of cumbersome and
          dead observances. The life of the Jewish system had withered, and
          the cup of bitterness of the Chosen People was fast filling up. But
          what could he or the little band of the upper chamber do, to clothe
          with flesh and life the dry bones of the dead religious faith of a
          dispersed race? Such were a few of his musings when he beheld the
          great throng, as they surged in and out before him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But suddenly the
          air grew thick, and a heavier cloud than that of the sacrificial
          smoke overshadowed the temple courts. It was growing late in the
          afternoon, and a sudden tempest was at hand, following the great
          heat. Anon a blinding flash of lightning and peal of thunder that
          shook the very foundations of the Temple. A darkness fell like that
          of night, which was made thicker by contrast with the flashes which
          now seemed like fiery serpents, shooting through and around the
          Temple, and leaping athwart the heavens. A panic seized the great
          throng, and there was a mad rush to escape. Cries of anguish rent
          the air, as many were trampled down by the affrighted mass. Many
          were <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name=
          "Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>crushed by the
          pressure of the crowd behind, and all semblance of order was lost
          in the great struggle for life. Men, women, and children were
          pressed against the platform upon which Serenus was seated, and
          even those who were able to keep upright were borne helplessly
          along. There was a chorus of groans almost below his feet. He fell
          upon his breast, and found that by reaching down to the utmost, he
          was able to grasp the hands of some who were borne upon the
          shoulders of others. In this way he was able to rescue not a few,
          by lifting them to the level of the platform where he was. By the
          light of a vivid flash, he saw in the drifting current an elderly
          man, upon whose shoulders there was a young woman, whose drooping
          form and pale face showed that she had swooned. The man who carried
          her aloft had a glimpse of Serenus above him, and cried out as he
          was swept along,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Take her! Oh, save her! save her!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By a supreme
          effort, Serenus was able to grasp her arm, and lift her to his own
          level, while he who had made the entreaty was quickly lost to sight
          in the irresistible moving tide and thick darkness. Serenus laid
          her tenderly down; and another woman, whom he before had lifted by
          his strong grasp, assisted in ministration. The face of the
          prostrate form was of the Jewish type, but her features were
          regular and beautiful. Her long black hair hung in wild confusion,
          as if to symbolize the disorderly scene through which she had
          passed. Her costume betokened refinement and social standing.
          Around her white neck there was a network of delicate gold chains
          interspersed with small precious stones. The <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>folds of her white loose-fitting robe,
          of soft texture, were gathered by a girdle woven of golden threads,
          from which hung pendants of small pearls.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a vigorous
          fanning and a little interval of rest, she gasped, opened her eyes,
          and slowly came to herself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O my father! where art thou? O Saulus!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus
          marvelled.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fury of the
          storm rapidly diminished. The great rushing tide of men, women, and
          children soon thinned out and grew sluggish. The darkness lifted,
          and the lightning-flashes and peals of thunder died away, but the
          great worshipful throng was demoralized and scattered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The panic began
          when some marble columns in the tier beyond the court of Israel had
          been struck by lightning, and shattered and thrown down, wounding
          several priests, who were washing their hands in the great brazen
          Laver. Such was the starting-point of the stampede which had been
          so disastrous and widespread.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rebecca was
          uninjured, and rapidly recovered from the prevailing fright and
          excitement. Except for the anxiety regarding the fate of her
          father, she was soon quite herself. She turned to her unknown
          deliverer to render him thanks.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          abundantly, for I have much joy in thy deliverance.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pallor and
          weakness which marked her face gradually passed away, and gave
          place to a look of interest and curiosity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rebecca was now
          able to walk, and they passed out through the Beautiful Gate in
          quest of Benoni. There were groups of people everywhere; many
          drenched by the great storm, some faint or wounded, and a few of
          the more helpless were being borne away by friends, or keepers of
          the Temple courts. But the father of Rebecca was nowhere to be
          found.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sky had
          already cleared, the air was sweet and fresh, and the sun

          fulness.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They passed out
          through the west Temple gate of the outer court, and down the long
          flight of steps along the slope of Mount Moriah. The steep descent
          caused Rebecca again to grow dizzy from faintness, and she leaned
          upon Serenus for support. He put his arm about her to save her from
          falling, and thus they made their way as rapidly as possible toward
          the Sheepmarket. As they entered a narrow street, they met, face to
          face, a young woman moving with a rapid step in the opposite
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name=
          "Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>direction. She gave
          Serenus a slight salutation, and quickly passed by. He was still
          supporting Rebecca, and was startled at the recognition. It was
          Amabel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Arriving at the
          inn, Rebecca invited Serenus to enter, and receive the thanks of
          her friends. But he made some plea of haste, and turned to depart,
          only saying,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Peace abide with thee!”</span></p>

          after, late in the afternoon, a little group were holding earnest
          converse in the court of the Sheepmarket inn. Abdiel, the venerable
          Rabbi of Tarsus, bewailed the changes which had come to pass in the
          Holy City since his long sojourn there many years before.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          proclaim their blasphemous doctrines in the synagogues, yea, in the
          very courts of the Temple on the Holy Hill. The streams which
          should flow out in pure volume to refresh and confirm the children
          of the Dispersion are becoming poisoned at the
          fountain-head.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          replied Almon. <span class="tei tei-q">“We may almost perceive
          heresy and false doctrine in the very air about us! It cometh
          mainly from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg

          them set at naught the Holy Place itself, while others continue in
          the ordinances of the Chosen People, but lightly esteem
          them.”</span></p>

          Messiahship, boasted that he could destroy the Temple in three

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the return
          of Saulus he had been earnestly occupied in the formation of plans
          for the uprooting of false doctrine, and the punishment of the
          violators of the ceremonial law. His zeal in this cause was only
          alternated and tempered by his periods of depression and
          uncertainty as to the affection of Cassia. His strength as a
          champion of the traditions of the elders was only equalled by the
          power of his love for her, but the former inspired strength and the
          latter weakness. He could face unnumbered heretics without a fear,
          but was vanquished by the sight of the innkeeper’s daughter. Day
          after day had swiftly passed since his return from Tarsus, but
          still he was utterly in the dark as to her real feelings.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name=
          "Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>She was friendly, and
          took a deep interest in all his plans for crushing the traitors in
          the camp of Israel, but more he could not clearly divine. He was
          holden from making any allusion to the involuntary eavesdropping
          upon the occasion of his arrival; and what he had heard on the part
          of little Cassia had been so indefinite that he lived in a
          condition of mingled hope, fear, and uncertainty. Barnabas was
          still at the Sheepmarket, but there was nothing in his actions to
          aid in the solution of the riddle. Saulus loved with all the
          intensity of his fiery nature; and he even persuaded himself that
          if Cassia loved Barnabas, he could do nothing but flee the Holy
          City, and so drifted along, not daring to find out the truth. The
          suspense could not much longer be borne.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As he retired to
          his chamber after the conversation, he sat down to commune with
          himself, and decide upon some course of action. His was no ordinary
          affection. The world without little Cassia would be a desert.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          upon the name of the strange deity of the Greek. I crave
          forgiveness, O Jehovah! I would not blaspheme. Perchance she hath
          crowded thee out of my heart, but my love is not born of the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The synagogue of
          the Cyrenians was in the valley of the Cheesemongers, a little to
          the northeast of the Pool of Siloam. It was a simple, square
          building, severely plain in the interior, with Scripture-texts
          printed on the whitewashed walls. The platform was enclosed by a
          rail, and occupied at times by any male member of the synagogue who
          could read and expound the Law. The seats were divided into two
          sections by a lattice-work partition, the men <a name="corr153" id=
          "corr153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class=
          "tei tei-corr">occupying</span> one side, and the women the other.
          The services were not confined to the Sabbath, but often held on
          other days of the week, and sometimes in the evening.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a bright
          morning, and the synagogue was thronged with worshippers, part
          being Sadducees; and there were also many Jews who were pilgrims
          from the countries beyond Judea, having remained after the Feast of
          Pentecost. It had been noised abroad that Stephanos, the eloquent
          young apostle of the New Faith, would speak touching the
          interpretation of the Law and prophets. Many knew of him; for he
          had healed some sick folk, and done signs and wonders among the
          common <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg
          154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>people. Abdiel, Benoni, Saulus, and Cassia
          convened with the congregation. The rulers of the synagogue had
          consented that Stephanos should lead in the exposition of Scripture
          for that day. Comely and youthful in appearance, he stepped upon
          the platform, and searching among the rolls of the Law, brought out
          many passages, which he read and briefly expounded as he passed
          along. He then re-rolled them carefully, and putting them away,
          addressed the assembly.</p>

          confusion in the assembly; and some were minded to bear Stephanos
          away by force, and others that he be permitted to speak. He raised
          his hand as a signal for silence, but the uproar continued. Finding
          that the tumult could not be quelled, he left the synagogue under
          the protection of a few apostles of the New Faith, declaring that
          he would speak further of the coming Dispensation on the
          morrow.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the evening
          of the same day, Saulus received the hearty greetings of his
          friends at the Sheepmarket. Besides the families of Benoni and the
          innkeeper, many of the former friends of Saulus, members of the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Urim</span></span>, came to encourage, and if
          necessary support, their valiant leader in the warfare he had in
          view. There was a secret gathering of the order the same evening;
          and it was finally agreed that all would be at the Cyrenian
          synagogue at the next meeting, and that Stephanos should not be
          allowed to speak.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After parting
          with his comrades for the night, Saulus returned to the inn. The
          evening was sultry; and he went to the house-top to breathe the
          fresh air, and cool the feverish emotions which stirred him. The
          moon was full; and the City of David, with the mountains which
          encompass it, lay spread out in clear outline and dreamy repose.
          Other persons were scattered in different parts of the commodious
          resort upon the roof; but as Saulus was in a troubled mood, he
          sought a retired corner where he could be alone. Absorbing as had
          been the interest in his people, their religion, and the impending
          conflict with Stephanos, his thoughts of these things were
          speed<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name=
          "Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ily crowded out by
          the ever-present image of little Cassia. She had been enshrined in
          his thoughts so long that she had gained a rightful residence, and
          he could not dismiss her if he would. She was the unanswered
          question that stirred his heart, ever pressing for solution, so
          that it kept his soul in a constant agitation. His ruling
          aspiration, learning, and leadership in the church of his fathers,
          nay, his whole character and life, seemed to be merged and
          transformed into a great passionate longing for the ever-present
          Ideal which was mirrored in his soul. It was the charming but
          uncertain centre about which everything else revolved.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The stillness of
          the starry heavens rebuked the madness of his wild passion, and
          pleaded eloquently for serenity among the disorderly elements of
          human attachment; but the appeal was unheeded. The pinions of his
          soul beat and were wounded against the bars of the cage which
          hemmed him in. A love so supreme was tyrannical, so that he almost
          wished to be freed, and that it might all vanish from his breast.
          He felt oppressed, fevered, and thoroughly enslaved. He leaned
          forward, bowed his head, and tightly pressed his throbbing brow. A
          misty, strange vision possessed him. Everything he beheld was being
          rent in twain. Some Force took hold of him, and he felt as if his
          own soul were severed and divided. At length he saw Cassia borne
          away through the air by some implacable Power, but her hands were
          stretched out imploringly towards him. He unconsciously uttered a
          deep groan, and the intensity of his agony aroused him. A quick,

          now echoing a great benediction, and the dread vision of an hour
          before had dissolved and was forgotten. Nothing henceforth could
          rend such a cementing of affection. They were one in love, motive,
          and religion; and there was but a single dream of the future. At
          length the agitation with which their souls had been surcharged was
          calmed, and a mystical and indescribable repose was borne in upon
          them. Not merely their own hearts, but the silvery sheen of the
          moonlight upon them, the still night air around them, yea, the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The spread of
          the New Faith, and the hold that it took upon increasing numbers of
          the common people of the Holy City, furnishes a wonderful
          illustration of the inner power of a simple, spiritual religion.
          Its purity and depth were outwardly manifested by the general
          subordination among its followers of the strongest of all human
          passions,—selfishness. They were so filled with the spirit of
          brotherhood that they counted it a privilege to put their
          possessions into the common stock, in order to give to each one as
          he had need. There was no forced or legal communism, but a
          voluntary local and temporary dominance of the great future human
          Ideal. The law of the inherent blessedness of giving out—whether of
          spiritual or material treasure—was practically realized, and the
          harmonizing and uplifting power of a true reciprocity proven. The
          exercise of a helpful ministry marked a real nobility and
          greatness, and its activities of relief and healing make up a
          unique epoch in human history.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Wherever
          religion has dropped from simplicity and spirituality, and become
          scholastic, dogmatic, ceremonial, or a matter of the State, it has
          lost its power to mould life, and heal the weaknesses and disorders
          of mind and body. With almost no organization, system, or theology,
          there was a dynamic quality among the primitive believers, the
          phenomena of which are worthy of the study of every one who would
          fathom the divine economy of man. A gospel, or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Godspel,”</span> was manifested. The joy and gladness
          which came from a demonstration of the practical working of the
          divine spirit in humanity was the natural fruit of a release from
          the shackles of a dead ceremonialism. It was a spontaneous outburst
          of what before had been within, but latent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The divine,
          unchangeable Perfection had not changed or improved in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“pouring out”</span> of the Spirit, but
          human receptivity was newly and voluntarily opened. Religion, as a
          spiritual life, introduces a practical oneness with, and
          re-enforcement of, divinity in man, which fruits in <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“wonderful works”</span> as a natural and orderly
          articulation. The bestowment of spiritual favor on the Godward side
          can never be less than full and perfect, else would there be
          variableness and uncertainty. Law, which is divine method, is as
          reliable in the spiritual as the material realm; and the same
          compliance with its orderly activity and employment will forever
          bring like results. The <span class="tei tei-q">“signs that follow
          them who believe”</span> will never fail, but belief in this sense
          signifies a spiritual understanding deeper than mere intellectual
          assent. A renewal of the marvellous <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“works”</span> of the Primitive <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Church will come whenever a like
          spiritual dominance over external conditions is gained. Chronology
          changes no law of Being. The divine economy, being eternally
          perfect, is not subject to the wavering moods of human vacillation.
          They must conform to it, and not it to them. Then, as man comes
          into at-one-ment with divine laws and forces, he is backed by their
          energy, and commands their accomplishments. The New Dispensation
          was new only to the awareness of man. The variation of personal
          standpoint makes a seeming movement of the whole divine Order.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus had been
          long ripening for the conditions which came into outward exercise
          so spontaneously among the primitive believers. In the earlier part
          of his life, while among the Essenes and Therapeutæ, he had
          witnessed much of the power which is linked to spiritual devotion,
          and participated measurably in it. His transparent character and
          inner development, with the active exercise of a healing ministry,
          had marked him as rare in attainment while young in years. But
          during his connection with the school of Gamaliel, these qualities
          were somewhat quiescent, while a more distinctive intellectual
          development was taking place. But under the influence of the new
          movement his spiritual forces came to the front in full measure. He
          was everywhere active in healing the sick, strengthening the weak,
          instructing the ignorant, and sowing the seed for a spiritual
          harvest. His miracles of healing came from an intelligent wielding
          of the divine potencies, which, unrecognized and latent, dwell in
          the inmost of every human <span class="tei tei-q">“image of
          God.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg
          164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the early
          morning of the day after the meeting in the Cyrenian synagogue,
          there was a street parade of Roman legionaries, as was usual at
          short intervals, that the people of Jerusalem might have constantly
          before their eyes the tokens of imperial dominion. The imposing
          military column started from the Tower of Antonia, and after
          marching around a long circuit, passed through the Square of the
          Sheepmarket on its return. Most of the Jews, especially the better
          classes, resolutely kept out of sight, with every portal and window
          closed, as the hated Romans passed by. But to the rabble, music and
          pageantry were attractive. The blare of trumpets signalled their
          approach. In advance was a vanguard of spearmen, with gilded
          helmets, mailed breastplates, and shields upon the left arm,
          marching with a rhythm so perfect that they seemed like a huge
          machine, working with automatic regularity and perfection. The
          bronzed faces, brown, muscular limbs, and mailed armor, with their
          exact mechanical swing, made them seem more like men of iron than
          of flesh. Then came the ensigns, with banners and pennants floating
          in air, and in their midst, upon a tall rod, an emblematic gilded
          eagle with outstretched wings. Next were bowmen and slingers in
          close column of ranks and files, stretching out far in the
          distance. Then a group of mounted officers, commanders of cohorts,
          and centurions with a guard, and long array of cavalry, all
          speaking eloquently of the heavy mailed hand of Cæsar. The huzzas
          of the soldiers were often answered by the hisses and sneers of the
          onlookers, but outbreaks were not frequent. But as they passed the
          inn of the Sheepmarket, Rabbi Abdiel <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>looked down upon them from the roof, and with
          a sudden impulse raised his arms toward heaven, and in a loud voice
          called down upon the moving mass the curses of Jehovah. At first
          the soldiers gave no attention to his maledictions except to send
          up a few jeers and shouts of derision; but as he continued, a
          centurion below gave an order to a rank of soldiers,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Enter and seize the Jewish dog! To the Tower with
          him!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was done,
          and the location of the offending inn noted. But there was no halt
          of the long, glittering column, which continued its winding march
          until it passed over the great drawbridge, and was lost to sight as
          it entered the broad frowning portal of Antonia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon his return,
          the Commandant of the Tower found a little deputation awaiting him
          with a petition. They were members of the congregation of the New
          Faith, who having heard that a tumult was probable at the Cyrenian
          synagogue, and that the young deacon Stephanos was in danger, asked
          for the protection of the Roman authorities. The request was heard,
          but refused, and they were flippantly dismissed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By Bacchus!”</span> said the Commandant. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We are not here to take account of all your
          hair-splitting religious quarrels and tumults. We understand them
          not, and have no care for them so long as Cæsar’s prerogatives are
          unquestioned. Fight out your own differences! Your petition doth
          not concern us!”</span></p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">
            &nbsp;
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At a later hour
          the meeting at the synagogue was to take place. Long before the
          time, the room was crowded <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>to the utmost, and a dense throng gathered in
          the streets outside. There was an air of unwonted excitement and
          expectation. Wild rumors had flown thick and fast, that Stephanos
          would boldly attack the whole ceremonial system, and that there was
          a strong faction organized for resistance. It was said that if he
          offended they might forcibly bring him before the Sanhedrin, which
          would be in special session.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The meeting
          opened. Stephanos arose calmly, and, after reading a few passages
          from the prophets, began his address,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Brethren and friends! Again with joy I proclaim unto
          you the first fruits of the New Dispensation of the Spirit of
          Truth. The Word of the Lord is increased; and mighty works, signs,
          and ministries are being wrought in our midst. From out of the dead
          works of your ordinances and traditions there has sprung a New
          Faith, even that proclaimed by the Nazarene, who rebuked your
          hypocrisy, and laid the foundation of an unseen and universal
          spiritual kingdom. Lo! as he hath prophesied, the Spirit is
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘poured out,’</span> and many not of the
          Levitical order are inspired to teach and preach.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Stephanos
          continued, he waxed eloquent, and spake with great vigor. It seemed
          not to be the young man himself who was speaking, but some mighty
          power which was manifested through him. A Spirit was within which
          was so intense that it shone through his face, and his words were
          so powerful that his hearers were spellbound.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the spell
          was broken by a signal which was at once followed by a fierce rush
          upon the platform. The bustling form of Saulus, with fiery face,
          flashing eyes, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg

          above the noise of the uproar his loud voice echoed through the
          synagogue,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Seize the traitor! Down with the blasphemer! Drag him
          out! To the Sanhedrin! To the Sanhedrin!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The members of
          the Society of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Urim</span></span> were in the forefront; and
          besides, there had gathered a rabble from the streets who were
          eager to join the mob. A little band of the disciples of the New
          Faith clustered about Stephanos with devoted and loving
          faithfulness, but acted only as a defensive shield, and were soon
          borne down by the force and ferocity of greatly superior numbers.
          Amid wild shouts and confusion the little band was scattered, and
          Stephanos seized and taken out of the synagogue.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ha! Where is the great kingdom? Hath it been set up?
          Where is its throne?”</span> said Saulus. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We shall make short work of thee and all thy kind!
          Come on, witnesses! To the Sanhedrin! To the Sanhedrin!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Stephanos was
          dragged up the steep road to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hall of
          Squares,”</span> where the august court was in session. On the way
          he made no resistance, and amid jeers, savage yells, and curses,
          was led along. With loud commands, Saulus headed the throng.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The seventy-one
          members of the Sanhedrin were seated at the farther end of the
          spacious hall, in tiers of seats rising from the centre, and
          sweeping around in an imposing semicircle. Annas was High Priest
          and presiding officer on this occasion. They had been apprised of
          the fact that Stephanos would be brought before them, and were
          ready to receive him. He was led in by Saulus and the witnesses; as
          many of the throng following as <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>could find room in the public part of the
          hall. Everything was ready, and pointed to a foregone conclusion.
          The charges were made; and the witnesses stood up, one by one, to
          confront and make testimony against their victim.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I heard him speak against the Holy Place, and
          blaspheme the Law.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I heard him declare that the doctrine of the Nazarene
          would destroy the Temple service, and do away with the Law of
          Moses.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I heard him say that he despised our sacred traditions
          and ordinances.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I heard him call our chief priests and Rabbis
          hypocrites, and speak of a new kingdom not of the Chosen
          People.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I heard him proclaim the Messiahship of the Galilean
          pretender, and blaspheme Jehovah.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I heard him speak against the Circumcision, and call
          the Nazarene the Son of God.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the High
          Priest, clothed in the imposing robes of his office, arose, and
          waving his hand, asked Stephanos to plead by answering the formal
          and customary question, <span class="tei tei-q">“Are these things
          so?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Stephanos arose
          to make answer. Young, handsome, and tall, with dignified manner,
          he wore an unwonted grandeur in looks, words, and action. He began
          an eloquent oration. As he proceeded, he seemed transfigured by an
          inner consciousness which fairly illumined his countenance. He
          looked his accusers in the face, and they quailed before him. Even
          the fevered and fierce glance of Saulus was cast down when the
          penetrating <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg
          169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>look of the saint was turned upon him. A
          marvellous inner light shone out through his face, which entirely
          transformed its expression. It was heavenly, rather than defiant,
          but to the onlookers it was awful. While it radiated love and
          spiritual exaltation, to them it was threatening and terrible.
          Overshadowed by the Shekinah, there was an intangible halo about
          him, in which they saw mirrored their own guilt and condemnation.
          As he continued, a raging passion boiled in their hearts, even
          though for a time they were spellbound. His amazing courage and
          stinging truthfulness were paralyzing, and they could no longer
          look upon that terrible face.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length
          Stephanos stopped short in his unanswerable argument, and there was
          a moment of silence. Then he gathered up the full measure of his
          righteous wrath, and hurled it in their indignant but shrinking
          faces. He denounced them as betrayers and murderers, and lashed
          them with invective, terrible but true. Then the awful spell was
          broken, and their pent-up hatred burst all bonds. The wonted sedate
          and dignified Sanhedrin exploded with anger. Unable longer to
          maintain any semblance of judicial procedure, they waxed hot,
          gnashed their teeth, clinched their fists, and hissed and howled
          like wild beasts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Traitor!
          Blasphemer! Slanderer! Reprobate! Heretic! were some of the names
          that were hurled at Stephanos from all directions. He was not
          abashed, but the burst of holy indignation which had gone forth
          from him was ended. It was aimed at their actions and customs
          rather than themselves. Though severe, it was not vindictive
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name=
          "Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>or intended for
          insult, but awakening. But reason was unavailing. Righteousness is
          a standing menace and rebuke to guilt. Nothing can be more
          hateful.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Stephanos lifted
          his eyes from the malignant faces, rendered demoniacal by surging
          passion, and looked up as if in a trance. The Sanhedrin, with all
          its bitterness, faded from his sight, and became to him as though
          it were not. An ecstasy was upon him, and he saw a beatific vision.
          While the human wild beasts around him growled and thirsted for his
          blood, his eyes were fastened upon a realm of eternal peace,
          harmony, and glory. His sublime and all-powerful faith ushered him
          into the kingdom of the Real, while the temporary and incidental
          shrank to their relative nothingness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Sanhedrin
          regarded itself as eminent, respectable, and humane, but its
          members were utterly unable to cognize the truth that was clear and
          open to Stephanos. To them their anger was a righteous anger, which
          exercised itself in the service of Jehovah. The psychological wave
          of rage swept every member of the Jewish High Court off his feet,
          and bore him on. But were they sinners above other men? History
          before and since teems with like transactions, among all nations,
          and in the name of all religions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Stephanos had
          spoken against things which were sacred and infallible. It was not
          alone his burning eloquence, but its terrible truth, that cut them
          to the heart and made their blood boil. But now his animate body
          was yet in their midst, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">he</span></span> was no longer there. He was
          listening to a heavenly harmony, and not to a deafening clamor.
          Expecting him to continue, they had <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>stopped their ears to shut out his polluting
          blasphemy. Then, with one impulse, they arose in a mass, and rushed
          upon him. Their decision was spontaneous, and without any legal
          formality or deliberation. They dragged him away to be stoned
          outside the city gate. The spirit of persecution transformed the
          dignified Sanhedrin into a revengeful mob.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus prompted
          the witnesses when they gave testimony, and when the explosion
          occurred was among the foremost. In the rush that was made from the
          hall to the street his diminutive form was at the front, and with
          glowing face and violent gestures he urged on their impetuous
          movement. As they passed along the streets toward the Damascus
          Gate, they were joined by great masses of excited men, women, and
          children. Stephanos made no resistance. Shouts and imprecations
          filled the air. The members of the New Faith, being few in number
          and non-resistant in their philosophy of living, made no
          opposition. No herald preceded him to proclaim his name and crime
          as was usual in regular cases of legal condemnation. No bitter
          draft containing frankincense to stupefy the senses, and take away
          the edge of pain and terror, was administered, and none was needed.
          Stephanos could not suffer; for he was already in the midst of
          spiritual liberty, joy, and peace. The seething mob hurried his
          animate form along, and passed out to the north of the city to a
          piece of open ground on the border of the valley of
          Jehoshaphat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Stephanos calmly
          kneeled down without being bound or fastened, still looking up and
          beholding a vision of glory. His upper garments were stripped off;
          and then, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg
          172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>for the first time, a regular proceeding was
          observed, in that the witnesses were to cast the first stones. At
          length all was ready, and for a moment there was a silence which
          was oppressive. Stretching out his hands toward his murderers, he
          besought from above their forgiveness, and gave them his
          benediction. The stillness continued, the witnesses were
          spellbound, and the throng awed and immovable. The supreme grandeur
          and spiritual beauty that shone through his face dazzled and
          benumbed them, and almost deterred them from their purpose. There
          was a visible shrinking, and each waited for the other to make the
          first move. But Saulus sprang forth and broke the spell. With
          frantic manner and loud voice, he cried,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“To your work, O witnesses! Finish the Blasphemer!
          Heresy must be crushed! Hand me your garments that nothing may
          encumber, and cursed be he who holds back.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tragedy was
          soon ended.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-lg" style=
          "margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em; margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">
              The body sank to earth, its resting-place;

            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">
              Not so the man. He lives to truth and right.

              Mounts on and up, though lost to mortal sight.
            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The crowd soon
          melted away; and many seemed fearful, oppressed, and ashamed of
          their part in the transaction. Even those members of the Sanhedrin
          who had accompanied the throng were troubled in spirit, and made
          haste to get away. But Saulus was undaunted, and returned exultant
          and proud. He made his way back to the Sheepmarket; but the news
          had preceded <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg

          congratulations of all except Rebecca.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the evening
          of the same day the little group met in the court as was wont.
          Rabbi Abdiel was of the number, having been released from the
          Tower.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          their precious traditions demands that false doctrine be uprooted,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am persuaded that this pestilent delusion must be

          shall take up the work with power, and the High Priest and the
          whole Sanhedrin will give me all authority. I glory in the
          effectual door that is open unto me whereby I may do such
          service.”</span></p>

          congratulation of his friends, gradually seemed to vanish, and he
          was almost forced to look within and become more familiar with
          himself. He was surprised at the clearness and depth of the picture
          of the scene of the day which seemed to be burnt into his very
          soul. The tragedy beyond the city wall stood out before him in
          every detail. The throng, the shouts, his own share, the murderous
          act of the witnesses, the kneeling victim, his entreaty of pardon
          for his slayers, all riveted his attention as keenly as when they
          were taking place. It was as though his mind had been a tablet of
          stone, with the whole scene deeply chiselled in characters which
          could never be erased or hidden.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The duty of the day is done, and well done,”</span> he
          said to himself; <span class="tei tei-q">“and now I will have rest.
          I bid farewell to this event, that I may be well prepared to
          continue the warfare to-morrow.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it would not
          depart.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay, begone! I would not live it over more
          to-night.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it became
          more obtrusive than ever.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thinking to
          divert his mind, he took a roll containing a copy of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Mishna,”</span> with its six hundred and
          thirteen precepts, and began to read them slowly in order. But even
          upon the roll, in the midst of the clearly inscribed lines which
          recited the Jewish code, there was the scene, the tragedy! He
          impatiently threw down the roll, and in the stillness seemed to
          hear a voice within.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thou art guilty! Thy peace hath forsaken thee! Thou
          art condemned! condemned! condemned!”</span></p><span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was startled,
          for the voice was so distinct that it seemed to come to the outer
          hearing. He stopped his ears to find if it were still audible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Condemned! condemned!
          condemned!</span></span>”</span> still echoed as before.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He arose and
          walked to and fro, and made audible answer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Cease thy railing! I am the defender of my people! I
          will fight blasphemy and heresy, and nothing shall hinder! The
          Chosen People will honor me! Away, and be thou choked, thou false
          and lying spirit! I crush thee, and will increase my deeds
          manifold!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He then
          extinguished his lamp, and retired to his couch for the night. But
          his sleep was broken, and he could not rest. He heard angry voices,
          groans, and noises, and saw horrible shapes. But at length, in the
          midst of a troubled sleep, he was suddenly awakened. Something
          seemed to have shaken him. With a shiver through every nerve, he
          sat upright, and saw a bright object in the blackness before him.
          His gaze was fastened, and he could not turn it aside.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Away! Away! Trouble me not!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
          brightness remained, and soon began to transform itself. Feature
          after feature came into distinct outline. It was a shining face.
          Calm, luminous, and grand, it gazed steadily upon him. His blood
          froze in his veins as he recognized the <span class=

          face</span></span> of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <span style="font-size: 144%">AMABEL’S REMARKABLE
          EXPERIENCE</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amabel returned
          to her father’s palace in a state of great disquietude. The
          unexpected meeting with Serenus, but vastly more its unwonted
          circumstances, gave her a great shock. What could it mean? Serenus
          walking the streets of the Holy City in the company of a young
          woman, a stranger, in a manner which betokened great familiarity!
          Such an event, witnessed by her own eyes, shook and threatened to
          disenthrone her Ideal, and to dissolve everything which she had
          counted solid and sacred.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since Amabel’s
          last interview with Serenus, she had striven loyally to banish his
          image from her mind, but with variable success. At times she almost
          seemed to feel his presence, and in other moods persuaded herself
          that she was quite resigned to the inevitable and final separation
          which had been wisely accepted by both.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amabel was an
          idolized favorite in the Holy City. Her grace and beauty, with the
          eminent position of the Rabban, gave her the highest social
          distinction. Who so happy as Amabel? The centre of an admiring
          circle, the petted daughter of tender parents, surrounded by
          luxury, active in kindly deeds, and loyal to her religion, what
          more could be desired? But a heaviness was in <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>her heart, and the world about her was
          prosaic and mechanical. Her social and religious duties were
          faithfully performed, and she enjoyed the favor and love of all;
          but, alas, a worm was gnawing at the root of a comely flower. There
          was a subtle unrest and secret blight that made life barren and
          joyless. She became introspective, and often tried to weigh her
          motives, obstacles, and aspirations, as in a pair of balances.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Is and the
          Might Be are always coming up for comparison and contrast in the
          human foreground. On one side, Amabel had home, friends, social
          position, and the accepted religion of her own people, and on the
          other, Serenus, his love, and a New Faith which seemed strange to
          her. Although Serenus had assured her of his devoted and undying
          affection, he had not asked or expected that she would renounce all
          for him. He had taken it for granted that she would not and could
          not. He had gracefully accepted the stern logic of the situation,
          and cheerfully made the great sacrifice. On her part, she had even
          withheld the confession of her own love, for the sole purpose of
          making his burden lighter, and his renunciation possible. As they
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">must</span></span> separate, it would be
          easier so.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the
          evening of the earnest avowal of love by Serenus, and the mutual
          acquiescence in the imperative separation, life had drifted along;
          but the whole world was changed. Her cheeks had lost their color,
          and there were many evidences of wearing preoccupation. But she
          made a heroic effort to fall into the current of what was expected
          of her, and firmly resolved to cease all iridescent dreaming, and
          be resigned.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg
          179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the chance
          meeting, Amabel arrived at home almost breathless, and avoiding the
          family, hastened to her favorite nook upon the house-top. Her heart
          was fluttering, her senses swimming, and she must have a little
          time. It was all important that she rally her forces, and lift
          herself above the sudden rush of waves which threatened to ingulf
          her. She began to reason with herself, and to cast about for some
          solid ground upon which she might stand. She could not interpret
          her own soul. There were two voices within, and each claimed her.
          Admitting her love for Serenus, had not all forever been settled
          between them?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But was there
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The thick
          curtains of night had been drawn, and Amabel was missing. The
          household of Gamaliel began to be apprehensive; but bethinking
          themselves of her favorite resort, ascended to look for her,
          believing she might have fallen asleep. Her prostrate form was
          found in a state of feverish unconsciousness. Kind hands bore her
          tenderly below, and loving hearts exercised themselves in every
          form of devoted ministration. Her body was motionless, except that
          her lips were moved in an incoherent muttering. The skill of the
          physicians was exerted to the utmost to arouse her, but hour after
          hour passed without any visible change. Her illness was
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name=
          "Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>found to be a violent
          fever in the head, and it was whispered that peradventure it was
          beyond the reach of the healing art. But however it might end, it
          would be long and desperate.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the next
          morning Amabel’s condition was somewhat changed. She moved
          restlessly upon her couch, and had recurring intervals of
          consciousness, but the burning fever was continuous. She begged for
          water and fresh air, both of which were denied her except in very
          sparing quantities, for fear of harm. Strong medicaments, of a
          quality which produced disgust and loathing, were faithfully
          administered, but no healing effect was manifest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How futile and
          superficial the devices of the healing art, in any and all ages, in
          its attempts to deal with maladies of the soul! And who will
          declare that the deep and obscure fountain of all ailments is not
          located in the unseen and immaterial part! Verily the springs of
          man’s nature are hidden, while seen and secondary manifestation is
          upon the surface, being resultant.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Weary days and
          nights dragged their slow course along. At length the violence of
          the fever abated, but the pale face and wasted form spoke
          eloquently of the vanity of human effort in her behalf. Her glassy
          eyes and sunken cheeks proclaimed an impending collapse of the
          mortal tenement. The pure white soul was nearing the portal of the
          earthly tabernacle, apparently soon to step out.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The physicians
          solemnly announced that the end was not far away, and that it could
          not be averted. As a weary toiler at the close of day lays down the
          instrument <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg
          182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he
          has wielded, so the daughter of the Rabban must put aside that seen
          counterpart which no longer could serve her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gamaliel was
          bowed with grief. When not at the bedside of his daughter, he
          seemed dazed, and was barely able to bear the mechanical round of
          his daily duties. Was the sweet flower of his family to be
          uprooted? the light of his <a name="corr182" id="corr182" class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These were days
          of sombre stillness in the palace of Gamaliel. The birth-pains of a
          soul, as it passes into the higher life, are more outside than
          within. Everything around is smitten and takes up a plaint, even
          when the soul that goes is quickened, and its own path smoothed and
          lighted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Intervals of
          calmness and delirium alternated in their possession of Amabel. Her
          frame became so thin and transparent that the flashes of the
          pulsating self seemed to shine through, and reveal its vital
          dominance. But her incoherent utterances during periods of
          aberration, though very weak, gradually became more distinct.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          It was repeated again and again. This was made known to Gamaliel.
          He was a wise father and a prudent interpreter. He thought deeply
          upon the matter; and after a brief but sharp conflict in his own
          mind between parental <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg

              she speaketh of thee and calleth thy name. Peradventure thy

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The breast of
          Serenus was rent with conflicting emotions as he laid down the
          letter. Mingled with his sorrow at the sad tidings about Amabel,
          there was even a note of gladness. <span class="tei tei-q">“She
          loves me!”</span> was the thought that echoed and re-echoed through
          his heart. <span class="tei tei-q">“If her seen form is to vanish,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">she</span></span> is not the visible, but the
          invisible, and love is eternal. The grave can rear no wall nor make
          no gulf between us. Behold we dwell here for a season in tents, and
          then quietly fold them and move forward. Poor Amabel! She loveth
          me, but hid her love that she might not increase my
          burden.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          with the faithlessness of the world? nay, even of the ceremonial
          religionist? What do the physicians, who are persuaded that her
          life must go out, understand of the vital powers of the spirit?
          Their nauseous medicaments touch but the utmost surface of life’s
          visible expression. They wot not of its hidden springs, and how to
          take hold upon them! Even the eyes of Gamaliel, master in Israel
          though he be, are not opened to the Father’s helpfulness! Did not
          the prophet of Nazareth declare, <span class="tei tei-q">‘These
          signs shall follow them that believe’</span>? Behold neither the
          world nor the church doth believe! Have I not witnessed wonderful
          works among the Essenes and Therapeutæ? nay, are they not now
          common in the household of the New Faith? Is not the life of God in
          all things? and hath not every one that measure of it which he will
          open his soul to receive? Behold the Father withholdeth not, for
          all things are freely given to his children. His abounding spirit

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such were some
          of the thoughts that flashed through the mind of Serenus. While at
          first taken unawares, and cast down by the tidings of Amabel’s
          condition, he soon felt a mighty influx of faith and strength that
          filled him with spiritual energy. Nothing was impossible!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Can Amabel be inspired with such a faith? And behold
          her friends live not in the spirit, but in doctrines and

          so will it come to pass.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus lost no
          time in making his way to the palace, and was softly ushered into
          Amabel’s presence. His face betokened peace, yea, even commanding
          power. Knew he not that infinite forces were back of him? Yea, they
          were familiar, and by orderly method he would wield them!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Undaunted by the
          paleness and wasted proportions of the fair form, so changed since
          he last beheld it, his face almost shone at the thought of the
          privilege of spiritual ministration. Shrunken, weak, and
          motionless, to the outer eyes the life of Amabel, like a fitful
          flame, was just ready to expire. Serenus seated himself near by.
          Perchance she was dreaming, for soon there was a movement of the
          lips.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          whisper, but she had not yet opened her eyes. He heeded not the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A full half-hour
          passed, during which not a word was spoken. The place seemed
          hallowed with an invisible Presence. The gloom fled away before a
          brightness which might almost be felt. The life of Amabel is a part
          of the One Life, and knoweth neither limitation nor death! Depart
          thou belief of mortality! Child of God! thou art unseen spirit! It

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These words were
          spoken in a low, sweet voice; the first above a whisper for three

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus lightly
          took her thin and almost transparent hand, and bending his head,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day
          following witnessed a marvellous gain. The change was so great as
          to cause rejoicing and wonder in the palace. Amabel had remained
          free from unconscious intervals, and though yet weak, was calm and
          cheerful. Serenus came, and was warmly greeted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A week passed,
          and there was great joy in the household over Amabel’s recovery.
          Her strength rapidly returned, and all feebleness disappeared. Her
          cheeks regained their wonted freshness; and the outshining of her
          soul, through the large, speaking eyes, told of inner peace and
          exuberant life. Her recovery astounded the physicians, and her
          father was both puzzled and delighted. He was persuaded that his
          own prayers to Jehovah must have had efficacy, but his faith in the
          physicians as divinely appointed means was sorely shaken. But he
          was wise enough to perceive that his daughter loved Serenus, and
          that peradventure his presence was so pleasing to her that it had
          been helpful, but beyond that he saw nothing. It was impossible for
          him to think other than highly of the character of Serenus; but
          now, beholding the devoted affection of Amabel, he bewailed his
          heresy sorely. How could <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">he</span></span>, the eminent Rabban, with the
          eyes of all Judea upon him, ever sanction his deposed assistant?
          and as for making him his son, his soul was distressed at the
          thought. If Serenus was dear to him in person, his doctrines and
          associates were most hateful. He groaned in spirit, for Amabel was
          the idol of his heart.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the tenth day
          after his first visit, Serenus found Amabel in her favorite nook
          upon the roof. It was a balmy afternoon. The delicious atmosphere,
          not too warm, was barely stirred by a gentle breeze, and the Holy
          City never was more glorious and serene. The great Temple seemed
          almost transparent in its dazzling whiteness, and the clear air
          gave an unwonted nearness <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg
          191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to
          the more distant mountains. Amabel was the ideal of health, and
          there was an exquisite grace and purity in her looks not equalled
          before her illness. Could those rosy cheeks be the same that were
          so deathly pale and sunken a few short days ago? Verily a new
          spirit maketh all things new!<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6"
          href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amabel had been
          a willing learner, and her progress was rapid. The inspiration of
          the higher life and the New Faith fully possessed her. The world
          was a different world. Hand in hand with Serenus she had ascended
          the Mount of Transfiguration and gained a true perspective. Things
          that before were solid and real had become transparent, so that she
          could look through them, and behold the spiritual verities of which
          they were the cruder shadows. Her experience was not strange or
          abnormal, but she felt the natural unfoldment of an additional
          sense. It was orderly inner illumination. God in <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">present</span></span>
          manifestation was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">everywhere</span></span>, in terms of love,
          purity, beauty, and goodness. Former discordant thoughts had fled
          away, and the development of her own powers amazed her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Up to this time
          no word since her improvement had passed between Serenus and
          herself touching their personal affection. But she found all
          anxiety, the very intensity of which had caused her illness,
          entirely gone. Thrice happy Amabel! Her love had not lessened, but
          it was now refined and spiritualized. She had not be<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>come peculiar or preoccupied, for there
          was nothing sombre in the New Faith. Her light-hearted joyousness
          produced a bright ripple upon the whole surface of the life of the
          palace.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The afternoon
          was wearing away, and Serenus must soon take his leave. It was all
          too short for the lovers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Amabel! I rejoice with thee in thy freedom and
          happiness. Behold thou art like a bird released from a cage. All
          things smile upon thee, and the very air whispers its
          benediction.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is thou who hast guided my feet in the delightful

          "tei tei-q">“I have but showed thee the way to find thyself. To
          interpret our own divinity is to discover our real

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Blessed be the day which opened to me the spirit of
          the New Faith. Behold the religion of the Temple, with its smoking
          sacrifices and priestly ordinances, now seemeth like a hollow form.
          Its life is withered. I pray thee, why were the ceremonial
          observances handed down to us?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In the days of the ignorance and childhood of the
          Chosen People, they could not interpret the mind of Jehovah save
          through signs and symbols. Their understanding was not open to the
          life of the Spirit, so they must needs receive it veiled and
          softened by types. With a childlike trust they could get glimpses
          of God and his teaching through the ordained forms. The full light
          of Truth would have blinded their eyes, and been counted as
          foolishness. But now, learning of the head and a puffed-up
          knowledge hath hidden the simple faith of the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>patriarchs and prophets, and the symbols
          have become all in all, and therefore are vain and empty. A proud
          scholastic philosophy hath made the hearts of the people cold and
          barren.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I live now and henceforth in the New Faith,”</span>
          said Amabel earnestly. <span class="tei tei-q">“Pray, is the
          Nazarene of whom thou hast spoken its founder?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay, all truth is eternal! He was not its founder, but
          its expresser and embodiment. Only as the spirit is manifested

          the flesh</span></span> doth it come to the understanding of those
          whose concern is only with things that are seen. The Son, or
          likeness of God, dwelleth in all men, but he is almost unknown and
          unmanifest. Jesus, knowing his internal oneness with the Father,
          embodied the Christ-mind or life in its fulness, and performed the
          outward works after its kind. But, O Amabel! hast thou well
          considered that thou dost separate thyself from the faith of thy
          father and all thy house?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          and will show forth its power.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus drew
          nearer, and taking her hand in his, gave a gentle glance into the
          fair face at his side.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          life. Dost thy heart respond? and wilt thou be mine?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the second
          evening after the stoning of Stephanos, the members of the Inner
          Circle of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Urim</span></span> gathered in their room near
          the inn of the Sheepmarket. As they passed one by one through the
          long passage into the anteroom, and thence, as approved by the
          doorkeeper, through the narrow portal into their secret rendezvous,
          an unwonted interest was manifest in every face and feature. It was
          known that Saulus had been in consultation with Annas, the high
          priest, and Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, his kindred, and that
          plans for stirring events had been made, the particulars of which
          were to be made known to them. The venerable Rabbi Abdiel was
          present, as the special and honored guest of Saulus. It was an
          unwonted occasion when any from without were admitted to a
          gathering of the Inner Circle; but the desire of Saulus was
          sufficient, and besides, the Rabbi was already known to many, not
          only as faithful, but as intensely zealous for their
          contention.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When all were
          gathered, and the preliminary ritual <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>had been performed, two members escorted
          Saulus to the seat of the grand Dictator, and the Rabbi, as his
          guest of honor, was seated upon his right. At a given signal all
          arose, and with their peculiar mystic symbolism took anew the oath
          of secrecy, in which the Rabbi joined. All then were seated, and
          Saulus arose to give his report.</p>

          of Israel! Chosen of the Chosen People! A serpent hath crawled into

          head. Behold this day I have counselled with the chief priests and
          elders, and have received authority to bind all blasphemers, put
          them in prison, and scourge or stone them, as seemeth expedient
          unto me. The Roman Procurator hath given the Sanhedrin full power
          to deal with all matters pertaining to our religion, and will in no
          wise hinder the punishment that may be meted out to the followers
          of the Nazarene. We therefore bind ourselves to make havoc of all
          who are of the Way, and to uproot this vile heresy, and the
          blasphemy of the Temple and the Circumcision. Rise, comrades!

          his face grew dark, his jaws and fists were clinched, and his
          gestures violent. He seemed to be fighting some unseen enemy which
          was present and before him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length
          comparative quiet was restored, and plans were formed for an attack
          upon the disciples of the New Faith on the morrow. It was known
          that they assembled in the Upper Chamber every morning at the third
          hour. It would be easy to gather a rabble to do their bidding if
          they needed aid. They were just about to separate, when a sudden
          tremor passed over the frame of Rabbi Abdiel. His features grew
          rigid, his muscles tense, and he began muttering incoherent
          words.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He hath a trance, as he is sometimes wont,”</span>

          concerning us.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All had gathered
          about the Rabbi, who now began to speak more clearly, and in a loud
          voice.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tumult
          became so great that nothing more could be heard. Some were almost
          ready to smite him, but it was plainly evident that he knew not
          what he had been saying. Another tremor; then his frame relaxed. He
          was again himself, and astonished to see that all were gathered
          about him.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Rabban
          Gamaliel was astounded at the action of the Sanhedrin in the case
          of Stephanos. As the head of the most noted training school in
          Jerusalem, where Hebrew youth were transformed into teachers and
          Rabbis, his influence with the chief priests and elders was
          ordinarily undoubted. But against the wave of fanaticism and
          persecution which was now surging through the Holy City, he felt
          himself utterly powerless. While thoroughly loyal to the Chosen
          People, he, with a few of the more liberal Pharisees, had
          faithfully striven to stem the tide, calm the fierce and turbulent
          spirit, and prevent any physical violence toward the members of the
          New Faith. While he detested their doctrines, believed them to be
          the victims of delusion, and ridiculed the claims of the Nazarene
          as put forth by his disciples, he also counselled forbearance, and
          believed that such su<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg
          200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>perstition would soon wear itself out, and
          come to naught if let alone. His advice was entirely unheeded. The
          worst passions of the Sanhedrin, their followers, and the rabble
          were aflame, and logic and lore availed nothing. The stoning of
          Stephanos had been like the scent of fresh blood to a wolf.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The study of
          great psychological waves which sometimes roll over a community,
          and even a nation, is most interesting and instructive. A vast
          pent-up mass of human passion, perhaps long in accumulating, like
          the lava of a volcano, will occasionally find some outlet, and all
          pour out in that particular direction. It is thus that riots, mobs,
          revolutions, and wars originate. Like some strange epidemic they
          steal in, and gather momentum until they sweep everything before
          them. War between nations, which often comes from religious
          prejudice, is simply brute force and animal ferocity exercised on a
          colossal scale. There is no tiger more cruel than intolerant
          fanaticism, and the murder of Stephanos was like the unchaining of
          such a beast. It was the starting-point of a contagion of insanity,
          and Saulus was the fittest leader in which it found embodiment.
          Under the general support and sanction of the Sanhedrin, he became
          for the time commander, and directed its forces.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Early on the
          second morning after the notable tragedy, the Rabban Gamaliel sat
          in his private library in a meditative mood. The piles of inscribed
          parchments, and numerous shelves loaded with rolls of manuscripts
          rich with Hebrew lore, were undisturbed. The law, psalms, and
          prophets, the Mishna, Gemra, Hagada, and Halacha, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which contained the treasures of Jewish
          scholasticism, and the archives of ancient polity and literature,
          had no attraction. It was the problems of the present which were
          pressing upon the Rabban. Never had he felt so powerless and so
          unreconciled to events. Not only the Holy City, but his own
          household, seemed rent in twain. His former impetuous young student
          and disciple had suddenly blossomed into the Hebrew leader of
          affairs in Jerusalem, while his own influence had gone into a total
          eclipse. His beautiful and idolized daughter had bestowed the
          wealth of her warm youthful affection upon an avowed apostate. Even
          the thought subtly intruded itself, that it would have been more
          tolerable if her recent illness had been unto death; and he
          pictured to himself the possible resignation which would now
          possess him if her fair form were already sleeping in the quiet
          sepulchre. He bowed his head in agony as a chaos of conflicting
          emotions agitated his soul, and groaned aloud, and wept as a child
          might weep. All the fame, success, and usefulness of his past life
          was a hollow dream. His vaunted wisdom in the eyes of the Holy City
          had turned to ashes. Worse than all, it even had become foolishness
          to his own flesh and blood.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length he
          aroused himself as if he had arrived at some important and final
          decision. Honor, reputation, position, and religion must be
          maintained, even at the expense of family ties and affection. Shall
          not a man rule his own house? Putting his emotion under foot, and
          stifling the softened feeling which had possessed him, his features
          became hard and unyielding, and his lips tightly closed. He
          signalled a waiting-maid.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The young woman
          entered with a light though dignified step, and seated herself by
          her father’s side. She at once divined something unusual in his
          manner, and instinctively felt that an ordeal was impending.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just for a
          moment the Rabban wavered in the resolution which he had declared
          should be inflexible; for he had a distinct foreboding of a great
          trial, and of the magnitude of the sacrifice that he was about to
          ask of his well-beloved daughter. Be still, heart! The issue

          office, and religion are in the balance. Amabel! I ask thee to
          renounce all thought of a future alliance with Victor Serenus, and
          that thou promise to see him no more.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cheeks of
          Amabel visibly faded and her heart-beat quickened, but she
          maintained a good degree of calmness and self-command. She looked
          inquiringly into her <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg

          an inflexible will. She instinctively felt that the crisis of her
          life had come. There passed a few moments of silence, though they
          were not required for her to make her decision.</p>

          the time is no other than my former young disciple, Saulus of
          Tarsus. A wild and cruel spirit hath possessed the people, and the
          Sanhedrin is in full agreement. While I bewail the zeal of our
          people, which is not according to knowledge, and believe that its
          madness will soon pass by, I must bow before a storm which I cannot
          withstand. Even before this commotion an alliance of the family of

          abounded. Even the fate of Stephanos, and the prospect of a general
          persecution, did not seem to disquiet them. But they were unaware
          of the intensity of the storm that was just ready to burst, and
          that they were like sheep in the midst of wolves. The spirit of
          love shone through their faces, and many in the Holy City had been
          blessed by their ministry and service, healed of divers diseases,
          and released from bonds which had vexed them for years. Serenus was
          there, and had just arisen to address them. Barnabas and Peter and
          John were also among them. Barnabas had been drawn to the New Faith
          through the preaching of Peter, and was already one of the most
          devoted among the disciples. He had ended his sojourn at the
          Sheepmarket, and now made his abode with Serenus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amabel quietly
          entered. No one present knew her except Serenus, who marvelled at
          her sudden appearance. While aware that the new light had been
          kindled within her, and that she greatly rejoiced, he had
          entertained no expectation that she would openly identify herself
          with the despised people. Her exquisite grace and beauty, with the
          fact that she was an unwonted visitor, turned the attention of many
          towards her; but after a quick, tender glance at Serenus, she cast
          her large lustrous eyes downward, and closed them with a calm
          devotion, as she sank into her seat among the women of the
          assembly. The soul of Serenus was stirred within him as he began
          speaking to the little flock.</p>

          the mystery of evil, nor how resistance maketh it to increase. Love
          is finally victorious, because it thinketh no evil. God worketh not
          with observation, but in you, to will and to do. Thence cometh the
          victory! A man’s real foes must be they of his own household, for
          nothing can truly harm him but his own base and mistaken
          thoughts.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The address of
          Serenus was followed by spontaneous testimonies, prophecies, and
          spiritual affirmations, as each was inspired to give utterance, and
          all opened their souls to the Spirit of Truth. Then followed a
          period of stillness, during which each one lifted his mind to
          Christly ideals, and sent out loving and healing thoughts to all,
          not forgetting even those who were plotting against them. The
          silence continued until spiritual ecstasy prevailed, and aspiration
          and soul-communion lifted them to a state of consciousness where
          things of the seen and outward life seemed distant, and rested but
          lightly upon them. The calumnies and revilings concerning them
          which filled the Holy City were as nothing; for they were now in a
          heavenly frame made up of love, good-will, spiritual vigor, and
          harmony.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length the
          profound stillness was broken by a discordant hum in the distance.
          The cruel persecutors were upon their track.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The noise
          gradually came nearer, and soon resolved itself into chaotic
          vibrations of yells, commands, shrieks, and imprecations. Then a
          single stone was followed by a volley, which crashed upon the roof,
          sides, and windows of the Upper Chamber.</p><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mob rapidly
          approached. A small man with a strong rod in his hand was slightly
          in advance, making violent gestures, and giving loud commands. It
          was Saulus. Clustered about him were about two score of the members
          of the Inner Circle, and these were followed by a great rabble from
          the worst streets and lanes of the city.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The moments
          dragged slowly to the little band, for they instinctively took in
          the whole situation. After finishing the chants, the assembly was
          dismissed. No one tried to escape. Even if attempted it would have
          been impossible, for the house was entirely surrounded. They
          gathered in little groups, and friend encouraged friend.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus was

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tramp of the
          fierce host as it burst up the stairways was like the noise of
          thunder.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With glaring
          eyes and panting breath Saulus bounded into the room, closely
          followed by his comrades, with the mob at their heels. Not one of
          the assembly raised a hand in defence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The utter
          peacefulness and non-resistance of the little band was so strange
          that for a moment Saulus was astounded. He had expected a strong
          fight, or at least a desperate attempt to escape, but found
          neither. But in a moment he regained command of himself, and there
          was no wavering in his purpose.</p>

          crush this mockery of our holy religion. Ha! a little trial by
          scourging, and some acquaintance with stocks and prisons, will

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Up to this time
          he had not noticed that Serenus was among them, but as he beheld

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The persecution
          of the disciples of the New Faith formed a notable epoch in the
          history both of Judaism and Christianity. It was the first stage of
          an agitation, which, though subsequently losing some of its local
          intensity, widened and deepened until it changed the religious
          complexion of nations and the world. It marked the decadence of the
          existing ceremonial system, and at the same time dispersed widely
          the seeds of a vital faith which no opposition has since been able
          to stamp out.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">History confirms
          the apparent paradox, that living truth has thriven through
          repression; and even persecution. Stagnation and formalism have
          been its greater hindrances. It has such an inherent vitality that
          agitation and antagonism may justly be regarded as important
          factors in the evolutionary process which brings it into
          manifestation. It develops true vigor through the exercise of
          overcoming. Sometimes the Spirit seems to slumber beneath the crust
          of stagnation, until active hostility quickens its dormant energy
          and enables it to break forth. Good, therefore, is often nourished
          from seeming evil.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg
          212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The intent of
          the chief priests and elders was to <span class="tei tei-q">“slay
          the young child;”</span> but instead they multiplied him. The New
          Faith was like a fire, and the desperate effort to beat it out only
          scattered its brands among the endless combustible material of
          human hearts. Even at this early period in Jerusalem, the little
          flock that was apprehended and imprisoned formed but a small
          fraction of the three thousand souls which already had been
          possessed by the Spirit of Truth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before the ninth
          hour of the day upon which the assembly were thrown into prison,
          Gamaliel was informed of the wholesale arrest and persecution.
          Believing that the flight of Amabel would naturally be to the Upper
          Chamber, it occurred to him that peradventure she might be among
          the women who had been put in ward. The situation was intolerable.
          The thought that his own beautiful child, well beloved and
          delicately reared, was probably imprisoned with the offscouring of
          the Holy City, almost drove him beside himself. As he looked in
          upon the recesses of his own soul, there was a violent tempest, in
          which pride, disgrace, love, and anger were each striving for
          mastery, and boiling in wild confusion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The self-poised,
          reputable, and wise Educator of Jerusalem could hardly persuade
          himself of his own identity. How the events of a few hours had
          changed the whole world! He, to whom thousands had come from far
          and near to learn wisdom, not able to rule his own house and teach
          his own offspring! Oh, how much better if Amabel had quietly passed
          into the Beyond, as the physicians had predicted during her late
          illness! Then the better self made itself heard,—</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Oh, how I love her! I cannot give up my
          child!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bringing his
          thoughts to immediate events, the question again thrust itself upon
          him, Is she in prison? He was minded to seek an audience with
          Caiaphas, and lay the whole matter before him privately, but upon
          further thought, his pride and dignity revolted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length,
          realizing the strange fact that Saulus had suddenly mounted to the
          virtual leadership and control of the persecution, the Rabban
          resolved to send for him. He felt that, notwithstanding his fiery
          spirit, the influence of their former relation would make such a
          conference more tolerable than any communication with the chief
          priests. It was humiliating, but what better could be done? He
          therefore despatched a faithful messenger to the inn of the
          Sheepmarket, begging Saulus to come to the palace, upon a pressing
          matter, without delay. The intervening moments seemed all too long;
          but at length the former disciple, whose will had now become so
          imperious in the Holy City, was ushered into his presence. After
          the usual greetings, Gamaliel introduced the subject which lay so
          heavy upon his heart.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O my young friend and former disciple! I am in sore

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Before making known unto thee my special <span class="tei tei-pb"

          purposes, and those of the Sanhedrin, concerning the members of the

          Surely, as a teacher in Israel, thou must be mindful of this
          peril.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I have always felt persuaded, O Saulus, that every
          false philosophy would soon come to an end. I am mindful of the

          that they are harmful; but I am persuaded that, having no root,
          they will soon wither away. Dost thou not feel that persecution is
          unduly bitter, and that many who have been deluded will soon come
          back to the religion of their fathers if left alone for a little
          time?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay, worthy Rabban, thine age and much learning hath
          holden thine eyes to the urgency of the peril which hangeth over
          our people. There can be no better service to God and Israel than
          to kill this seditious conspiracy. If our righteous persecution be
          sharp and quick, behold it will save much trouble. It will prevent
          the spread of the blasphemy, and confine the severity to a small
          number. It were therefore <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          the death the betrayers of the Circumcision, before they multiply
          their proselytes. Of this the Sanhedrin is fully persuaded, and
          hath given me full authority to make an end of the
          matter.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gamaliel
          recognized the hopelessness of further argu<span class="tei tei-pb"

          bring about any moderation of the spirit and purpose of the
          persecution. His opinion of the quality of the New Faith differed
          little from that of Saulus; but they were utterly unlike in their

          giving up my favor, affection, home, and honor. Peradventure she

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gamaliel
          brightened at the renewal of his own hope, and added,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus took his

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Looking over the
          roll, he replied in the affirmative.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus disdained
          to make any explanation, and left at once, without waiting to see
          her. Gamaliel had requested that his name be not mentioned, and it
          was therefore impossible that she should be conducted to the
          palace. It would lead to recognition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The jailer went

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She passed out

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whither would
          she go? Her father’s house had been closed against her. Hesitating
          but a moment, she turned her back toward Mount Zion, and passing
          northward, continued along the narrow street that led beyond
          Hezekiah’s Pool, at length coming to the home of Serenus. She
          knocked at the humble door, and was warmly received and ministered
          unto by his mother, who welcomed her as her own daughter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus returned
          to the Sheepmarket near the close of the eventful day, feeling that
          his work was well begun.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The more
          prominent leaders in the sedition had been gathered in, and were to
          await his persuasive tactics to force their sworn renunciation of
          the New Faith, and blasphemy of its prophet. Failing in this,
          adequate punishment would be meted out under his direction, and at
          his convenience. He felt a peculiar pride that he had the honor of
          being the chief instrument in the hands of the God of Israel to
          correct, not only religious, but political transgression. Among the
          circle at the inn, he was received as a hero and public benefactor.
          Cassia bestowed her congratulation, and was delighted with his
          campaign of persecution.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O my devoted Saulus! thou art a brave leader, chosen

          enemies.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg
          218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thy words are sweet unto me,”</span> replied Saulus,
          as they seated themselves in a secluded recess of the court, while
          the twilight fell upon them. He put his arm around her light form,
          and drew her close by his side. She was very happy. During a few
          moments of silence, her heart was so full of golden dreams of the
          future, that she wished she might look in and behold it, as in a
          mirror. The music of fancy, unheard without, filled her soul with
          melody; and amid stirring scenes, her lover was before her day and
          night. The embrace of his arm tightened, and she nestled her head
          upon his shoulder. Saulus was transported to a new world as he felt
          her silken locks and warm breath upon his cheek, and for a little
          time he forgot persecutions and prisons. Following the swift flight
          of his imagination, he saw before him, not only his complete
          triumph in the contest he was waging, but a heaven upon earth, soon
          to begin, with the full fruition of his love, and the possession of
          the idol which for years had ruled his heart.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That wonderful
          intensity of nature which made Saulus a fiery persecutor rendered
          him a most ardent lover. There was nothing commonplace or mediocre
          within him. The whole fabric of his character was woven of
          extremes, all of which were in unceasing vibration.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Would the love
          of Saulus, now so exclusively centred upon one personality with the
          intensity of a white heat, ever become broadened, purified,
          disciplined, and diffused? Could this stream of soul-force, now so
          narrow and vehement, ever spread out, and in gentle volume nourish
          barren brown fields, clothe them with living green, and make them
          bud and blossom? No! says the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>world. Impossible! replies sensuous logic and
          intellectual acumen. <span class="tei tei-q">“Can the Ethiopian
          change his skin, or the leopard his spots?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The persecution,
          now so thoroughly inaugurated, raged with unabated ferocity. Dark
          and cruel weeks dragged their weary course into months, and the cry
          of martyrs was unceasing. But the heroism of the disciples of the
          New Faith was a marvel. Under the inquisition of Saulus, men and
          women were scourged, buffeted, put in confinement, and stoned; and
          though a few recanted, nearly all were faithful. The courage and
          spiritual inspiration which had possessed Stephanos continued, and
          in many cases even stoning to death produced only painless
          transition. The prisoners healed each other’s distresses, and often
          the persecutors themselves received from their victims some of the
          outward fruits of the power of the New Faith. But the bigoted
          inquisitors seemed possessed of a collective insanity or demoniacal
          obsession, outbreaking waves of which abound in history.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would be
          discordant to the purpose and philosophy which these pages aim to
          express through depicted events to enlarge upon this period. A
          tragic story of terrible things that abounded during this spell of
          unloosed animal passion might be dramatized, which would be well
          within the limits of the admitted facts of history.<a id=

          that every tale built upon the principles of idealism, and the
          portrayal of idealistic character, cannot do without a setting and
          background of contrasts which will bring truth into high relief,
          but the dark shades should be kept in subordination.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length the
          time came when the New Faith, like a smothered and beaten
          conflagration, appeared to be thor<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>oughly stamped out in Jerusalem. Every
          suspected house had been visited, and every implicated man or woman
          tortured or imprisoned, except such as had fled to remote
          provinces, which were not a few. But Saulus was not content with
          the complete conquest of the Jewish capital. Finding that some had
          slipped from his grasp, he began, like Alexander, to look about for
          other worlds to conquer. Being informed that a few had fled to
          Damascus, and were there promulgating the heresy, he made ready for
          an expedition to that city, and received from the Sanhedrin the
          necessary authority and equipment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The terrible
          strain of conflicting emotion and surging passion which had rent
          the soul of Saulus, fearfully told upon him. His haggard face,
          nervous unrest, sleepless nights, and hellish visions, produced an
          epileptic condition which appeared in the form of occasional
          paroxysms, and its scars were never afterwards fully removed. They
          were ever a <span class="tei tei-q">“stake in the
          flesh.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At times, during
          these feverish months of delirium, the scourgings of conscience
          were terrible. But the more desperate his torment, the more he
          hardened himself. Nightly visions of strange horror disquieted him.
          Often during the darkness, the sighs and groans of his victims
          echoed and re-echoed in his ears. He refused to be alone at night,
          and under plea of illness arranged for one of his comrades of the
          Inner Circle to share his apartment. His brief periods of strange
          relenting were not mentioned to his friends, and on no account
          would he have had Cassia suspect them. Each short interval of moral
          upheaval was followed by a more desperate deter<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mination to push the persecution. To
          have every nerve tense with a hot pursuit for his prey had peculiar
          charm, and yielded a thrill of delight to that part of his nature
          which he thought to be himself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Toward the last
          of the persecution, the flashes of goodness and moral sanity
          increased in frequency. Seeming to come up from within, they
          staggered his understanding. He reproached himself for such
          occasional weaknesses. Each time as they passed off he braced
          himself anew, and hastened to his appointed work.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last evening
          of the sojourn of Saulus in the Holy City was drawing to a close,
          and his preparations for an early departure the next morning were
          complete. The day had been sultry, and the family group at the inn
          were upon the house-top. The full moon, which silvered the broad
          expanse of towers and battlements, seemed to wear a sinister and
          ghastly aspect; and there was a redness in its sheen which gave
          Saulus a slight inward shudder. The shadows cast by surrounding
          objects were unwontedly sharp and black, and he felt
          preternaturally sensitive and expectant. The stirring events of his
          life in the Judean capital surged in a quick torrent through his
          mind, as if painted upon a swiftly revolving canvas. Love, hate,
          joy, despair, and ambition, sprinkled with the ashes of an inner
          and strange remorse, danced in chaotic confusion before him.
          Unwelcome and forbidding enemies seemed to be prodding him from
          within. Had he not done his duty well?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cassia
          interrupted his revery, and together they sought a retired corner
          as they were wont. A long converse followed. Mutual vows were
          exchanged and renewed, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class=

          upon the return of Saulus from his campaign in Damascus. After a
          long-continued rehearsal of mutual visions of present and future
          bliss, the moment for parting was at hand. Saulus was about to
          arise from his seat; but with eyes suddenly fixed upon vacancy, he
          gave a quick gasp and sank back.</p>

          fair white arms around his neck to reassure him. After a brief
          conflict with the unknown, but with no effort to disengage himself

          limbs shiver. I see something near at hand which is not of earth,
          and the darkness seems full of terrible shapes. But I spurn and

          charged with malignity, and every breath feverish and bitter. He
          tried desperately to fasten his thoughts upon Cassia, so as to shut
          out dire fancies. Thus for a few moments he would perch upon
          empyrean heights, only to be quickly cast down into horrible

          delirium seemed to gather in the darkness, and nameless Horrors
          danced around and leered at him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, from
          sheer exhaustion, and in a cold sweat, he fell into a troubled
          sleep. But phantoms in kaleidoscopic array peopled his dreams. At
          length three loud raps at the door aroused him, and froze the blood
          in his veins. There It stood!</p>

          back to his couch, more uncertain who and what he was than
          ever.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A hellish

          faint flush of dawn entered through the casement of his chamber,
          turning the blackness into gray, Saulus awoke from a half-conscious
          despair, and, wonder of wonders, a feeling of heavenly harmony
          possessed his soul! Peace, like a broad, glassy river, was borne in
          upon him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Iridescent tints
          of beauty filled the room. His soul floated through, and was bathed
          in a symphony of harmonious sound-waves, sweeter than a thousand
          harps of Æolia. The atmosphere seemed charged with an impersonal
          and universal love, and its message was written in letters of light
          upon the walls of his chamber. The fragrance of roses was wafted in
          upon his bewildered senses. A heavenly chorus of benedictions,
          distant, but enchanting in quality, reached him, as though echoed
          and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name=
          "Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>re-echoed through
          long corridors. He felt his soul expanding and responding, as he
          seemed to inhale a spirit of inspiration. An angelic visitor in
          white robes stood before him, and whispered, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am Prophecy,”</span> and with a winning smile
          pointed upward. What a vision! What brightness! What beauty!</p>

          the room was still—so still! The silence might almost be felt. What
          a strange calmness! The soul of Saulus was as placid as the
          mirror-like surface of a pool untouched by a zephyr. He heard a
          voice, distinct, but so low and sweet that he could not tell
          whether it were audible or in his soul.</p>

          dawned brightly, and found Saulus as he was wont. Oh, how vivid the
          visions! It seemed as if he had wandered for a whole night in the
          infernal regions, and anon been transported for a brief morning
          hour to heaven. How utterly indescribable!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          not, and the appointed hour for departure was close at hand. He

          comrades, who were to accompany him, were already waiting, and
          impatient for the start. Waving Cassia a final adieu, as she looked
          down from her casement, Saulus and his retinue wound rapidly
          northward through the narrow streets, and passed out through the
          Damascus Gate. Before the sun had climbed far above the horizon
          they had left the Holy City well behind.</p>

          that we return, and gather up a few threads that were dropped at
          the close of the chapter preceding the last. On the eventful
          morning when the comrades gathered at the Sheepmarket, and departed
          for the Upper Chamber to apprehend the assembly, there was a small
          party left behind which demands further notice. A controversy took
          place, and the little circle was rent by the decided and outspoken
          condemnation of Rebecca of the proposed movement.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Saulus seems beside himself in this mad
          persecution!”</span> she exclaimed with a deep flush. <span class=

          and be free from molestation. God speed their escape!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Daughter! thou speakest wildly!”</span> said Benoni
          reprovingly. <span class="tei tei-q">“I bid thee hold thy peace! It
          would have been well for us had we left thee in
          Tarsus.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rebecca said no
          more, but held her own thoughts firmly. Since the stampede from the
          Temple, when her life was saved by the young stranger, she had made
          many apologies for, if not an actual defence of, the disciples of
          the New Faith. Her unknown rescuer had not told her that he was one
          of them, but she had an indefinable feeling that he might be of
          their number. His words and spirit were unlike those of any one she
          knew who was subject to the ceremonial system. How opposite in
          temper from her own brother, whom she began to fear was possessed
          by an evil spirit! It was not so much what Serenus had said, when
          he conveyed her to her home in her faint and exhausted condition,
          for their conversation had been brief and general; but his
          dignified mien, lofty spirit, and utter unselfishness greatly
          impressed her. His very presence had seemed an inspiration. How
          strange, that in answer to her question he should have announced
          himself merely as the <span class="tei tei-q">“friend of
          Saulus”</span>! Knowing nothing of his name or dwelling-place, she
          often wondered whether she might ever see him again. While
          naturally retiring, and rarely looking into the faces of strangers,
          it must be confessed that, as opportunity offered, she had some dim
          expectation that she would again behold the face of her kind
          benefactor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Who is able to
          unravel the mysteries of a maiden’s heart? Who can untwist the
          delicate strands which, when combined, are able to guide and draw a
          gentle soul, and give it the force and direction of a new
          orbit?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the case of
          Rebecca, the vital service rendered would, of itself, make
          gratitude strong and lasting. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>lofty principles expressed, though in a brief
          and unstudied way, would also strike a unison in such a pure and
          intuitional nature as that of Rebecca. For a long time she had been
          quietly growing away from the heartless formalism of her people.
          She was ready for something better. Without knowing anything of the
          letter of the New Faith, peradventure its invisible vibrations were
          beating gently upon the strings of her higher nature, even though
          unrecognized.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Was there a
          mingled element of unconscious love subtly growing out of so brief
          an episode? What more natural? and yet what prophet can say either
          yea or nay?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Saulus and
          his concourse moved away toward the Upper Chamber, an intense
          interest and curiosity possessed those who were left behind as to
          the outcome of the day’s proceedings. All felt that an important
          crisis had arrived. Cassia was exultant, while Rebecca was cast
          down. But despite their unlikeness, they preserved friendly
          relations for the sake of Saulus. Prospective sisterhood rendered
          each forbearing. Rebecca was sorely tried, but must needs not rebel
          against her surroundings.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Almon, the
          keeper of the hostelry, who had followed the concourse in the
          distance, soon returned, and announced to the family that the
          blasphemers were securely under arrest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I bear you good tidings,”</span> said he, as with
          manifest glee he entered the court of the inn. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Saulus and his friends have the whole band under
          arrest, and they are soon to be taken in a procession to
          prison.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cassia clapped
          her little white hands with delight. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>Rabbi Abdiel and Benoni were exultant in their
          approval, while Rebecca was silent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold,”</span> continued Almon, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the direct way from the Upper Chamber to the prison
          leads by the inn, so that captors and captives will soon move past
          our very doors.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“To the house-top!”</span> exclaimed Cassia excitedly.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us all go up and see the procession
          when it passes.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She bounded up
          two stairways in hot haste, and the others soon followed. Rebecca
          would fain have been spared the sight, but something seemed to draw
          her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is
          frequently an indescribable fascination in beholding just that
          which one does not wish to behold.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is a proud day for thy son, O Benoni!”</span> quoth
          the Rabbi.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yea, my brother; Saulus directs all this matter as
          seemeth him good.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They had not
          long to wait.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the
          distance, fierce cries, cheers, and curses echoed above the general
          hum of voices; and soon a black mass of moving figures surged
          slowly along one of the narrow streets that led into the square.
          Near the front was the untiring figure of Saulus, directing the
          movement of the throng. His eyes flashed, his step was firm, and
          his air that of a military conqueror returning from a victorious
          campaign.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the motley
          crowd came near, the little group ranged themselves along the
          parapet that they might observe every feature of the procession.
          From their vantage-ground, it was easy to study every face, as it
          passed directly in front.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The venerable
          Abdiel waved his hands with satisfac<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>tion, and blessed the God of Israel; and
          Saulus, looking up, proudly returned the salutation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Near the head of
          the line of prisoners was a tall, dignified young man of noble
          presence and calm features, whose bearing and costume marked him as
          one of the most notable among them. Rebecca saw him, and
          instinctively exclaimed,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is he!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the same
          moment, the young man turned his eyes upward, and their glances
          met. A slight nod of recognition passed between them, which was
          noticed by the others, so that Rebecca was forced to explain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Almon also gave

          of evening were far advanced, the hearts of Amabel and the mother
          of Serenus were made glad by his arrival. Their surprise could
          hardly have been greater had he dropped from the skies.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          disquiets me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amabel’s cheeks
          grew pale, but she was silent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          formerly in doubt hath now been made clear to me. While in the
          prison cell, the Inner Guide prompted me that I should depart, but
          I wot not how it would come to pass. I must go, even to Rome, that
          from the heart of the world I may witness for the
          truth.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He cast an

          in hand to plant the standard of a pure spiritual religion? Canst
          thou with me bear hardship and seeming dishonor, yea, and
          peradventure further persecution, for the love of God, the sake of
          truth, and the good of thy kind?”</span></p>

          succor the distressed, strengthen the weak, raise the fallen, and
          awake those who sleep, whether in the flesh, or in dead works and
          ceremonies. The Voice within me says—<span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mother of
          Serenus placed her hands upon the heads of her children, and gave

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Everything was
          speedily arranged for an early departure on the morrow. An ordained
          disciple of the New Faith, who lived hard by, would come in at
          early dawn and unite Serenus and Amabel in marriage, according to
          the simple rites of the Upper Chamber. Before the midnight hour
          every preparation was completed for the new life so soon to
          begin.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the morning
          mists were being dissipated, and the Temple roof gilded by the
          first rays of the rising sun, Serenus and Amabel, well mounted on
          small but hardy steeds, passed out through the gate leading toward
          the seaport of Cæsarea. The mother was to follow in a few days in
          the company of a convenient caravan.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">
            &nbsp;
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Passing forward
          at a single bound, over the months of hot persecution noted in the
          preceding chapter, during which Serenus and Amabel were far away,
          we rejoin Saulus and his band on the way to Damascus. The first
          stage of the journey was over the Roman road which led from
          Jerusalem to Cæsarea.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the Judean
          sun climbed higher in the heavens, and poured out his fiery rays,
          they rode rapidly along the hill-country which forms the divide
          between the valley of the Jordan and the Mediterranean. At
          intervals from some elevated spot over which the route led, they
          would halt for a few moments, and cast a lingering look backward
          upon the now distant golden Temple roof, and the white towers and
          battlements which they had left far behind. Anon a far-searching
          glance to the westward <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg
          236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>would faintly disclose the deep blue of the
          Great Sea. Every foot of the way was rich in historic association
          to the Israelite, and every town and village consecrated by some
          event which formed a part of the national folk-lore.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The companions
          of Saulus proposed a rest of a few hours during the intense heat of
          the midday; but he refused to make more than a brief stop, barely
          permitting space to feed the animals and satisfy their own hunger.
          He was even impatient at the ordinary rate of progress, and was
          minded to hurry forward. The next morning they saw Mount Gerizim,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the Mount of Blessing,”</span> towering up
          in the distance before them. Upon that bald, brown summit Moses had
          stationed the priests and Levites, to bless the Children of Israel
          when they passed over Jordan.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The route wound
          through the soft green fields which lie around the base of the
          mountain, and midday brought them to Shechem in Samaria, where they
          stopped for refreshment. On this hallowed ground Jacob had encamped
          and erected an altar, and here Joseph had been sent to seek his
          brethren. On this spot Joshua had gathered all the elders and
          judges of Israel, and they <span class="tei tei-q">“presented
          themselves before God.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus was
          familiar with all this rich heritage of national history, so full
          of meaning to the Chosen People; but now it palled upon him, and
          seemed dim and distant.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Leaving the
          Roman road at this point, they took the Damascus route to the
          northeast, which was much more rough and difficult. Passing Mount
          Ebal and Mount Tabor, and skirting the beautiful Sea of Galilee,
          set <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name=
          "Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>like a gem amid the
          surrounding hills, they pressed on, until on the morning of the
          sixth day they found themselves not far from their journey’s
          end.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the west, and
          parallel with the last stage of their journey, the lofty chain of
          the Antilibanus stretched itself, like a huge wall, northward and
          southward as far as the eye could reach. Crowning all, with serene
          dignity and cool and dazzling whiteness, snow-capped Hermon formed
          a strange contrast with the torrid Syrian wilderness which
          immediately surrounded them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two hours more,
          and now, in the far distance, there was dimly visible the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Eye of the East,”</span>—beautiful
          Damascus. On they pressed, and it gradually enlarged. Now its white
          terraced roofs and cupolas began to resolve themselves, and assume
          shape and character. In what a mass of living green was the city
          embowered! Behold a great wide-stretching emerald oasis was in
          front, in striking contrast with the bare brown desert, within the
          confines of which they still lingered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon they passed
          for a short distance over one of the spurs of the Antilibanus, and
          could look down and follow with the eye the courses of the long
          winding Pharpar and the <span class="tei tei-q">“golden
          Abana,”</span> as they transform the wilderness, and cause it to
          bud and blossom like the rose. What wonderful beauty!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By Eastern
          metaphor Damascus was <span class="tei tei-q">“a handful of pearls
          in its goblet of emerald.”</span> The perennial streams from
          Lebanon spread into rivulets, and gurgle and disport themselves,
          forming the bases for blooming gardens of flowers and fruits—a
          terrestrial paradise.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again they
          descended to the brown, scorched plain, <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>and the torrid noonday was at hand. But before
          the flight of another hour they would be in Damascus, encircled and
          refreshed by its clear cool streams—their journey ended.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The time since
          they had left Jerusalem seemed well-nigh age-long to the young
          zealot. Deprived of the hot hunt, which for months had hardly
          afforded space for a quiet thought, he was forced to think. In vain
          he essayed to still the confused hum of the mechanism of his soul.
          To a mind under less intense pressure, and free from a stored-up
          mass of vivid tragic pictures, the changing scenery and stirring
          events of the journey would have afforded occupation. But to Saulus
          every hour was an hour of agony, its slowness interminable.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The outward
          world of variety and beauty meant nothing to Saulus now, for he was
          dwelling in a thought-world of his own contriving. He had walled
          himself around with abnormal and inhuman elements, and look which
          way he might, they must stare at him, face to face.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nearer, vastly
          nearer than his surrounding comrades, were the living, barbed
          thoughts, which like imps of darkness peopled his mind.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the walls and
          corridors of his soul were hung, high and low, moving, burning
          panoramas, and gaze upon them he must. The hellish art, which he
          had unwittingly moulded and upreared, thickly curtained the
          picturesque hills and valleys, the grand mountains, blue seas, and
          flowing rivers, which were incidental to the journey. The prods of
          an ox-goad to his outer flesh would have seemed tolerable could
          they have been re<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg
          239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>ceived in exchange for those unseen goadings
          which punctured his guilty consciousness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What subtle and
          often warring forces make up the mind of man! How it may kindle,
          unwittingly and even conscientiously, at its own centre, hellish
          flames; while the same energies, used after the divine order, will
          create heavenly harmonies and immortal loves!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How prolific are
          thought-activities, and how blind the world to the related
          sequences which are bound to them by hooks of steel! How untiringly
          the false self, in the ignorance of its own deeper nature, forges
          bonds for its own inthralment!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But though
          unheeded, the Inner Guide is ever awaiting an opportunity to blaze
          the path to freedom.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It matters not
          that the intangible scorpions which sting the human consciousness
          have been invoked in the name and guise of religion. Their
          retributive venom is not thereby lessened.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each soul rears
          its own dwelling-place, and puts in furnishings which correspond.
          The objective divine order is good, and only good. Those spectres
          and distortions which are called wrong, evil, and even hell, which
          shrivel and blast human lives, are the creations of disorderly and
          unregulated thought-forces. The beautiful stuff from which both an
          inner and outer paradise may be builded is strewn around in endless
          profusion. It is mis-direction which makes it <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“evil.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before
          demonstrating beauty and perfection, men make educational mistakes,
          but the mockery and hollowness of failure finally drive them to the
          Real.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hell is
          corrective rather than vindictive, a condition <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of mind, and not a place. It is as
          possible in this realm as the next, and Saulus was there. He was a
          realist, and had lived entirely from the outside. No lighter
          measure of flames would have sufficed to bring him to himself, and
          lead him to discover true being.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Punishment is
          kindly in its mission to the world. Man would fain sever cause and
          effect, but God has bound them together. Had not a flame in the
          soul of Saulus broken in upon his persecutions, they would not have
          been arrested.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Purifying fires
          reduce the Counterfeit to ashes, and then man is revealed to
          himself in his inmost and divine image. If evil were an objective
          Reality, when would be its end? Thanks to the Universal Order, it
          is but a subjective disciplinary experience, and carries within the
          seeds of its own limitation and final dissolution.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mingled with the
          agony which made up the weary days and nights of the journey,
          Saulus had brief ecstatic upliftments and visions. Often they would
          pass into short trances, when he would lose all sense of time and
          surrounding, and dwell in the realm of the unseen. His violent
          transitions, often accompanied by some physical epileptic symptoms,
          were a source of great wonder to his companions, who were
          exceedingly superstitious concerning such weird phenomena. Was he
          possessed at times of good and evil spirits, or was he on the verge
          of lunacy?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The strange and
          ungovernable moods of Saulus, with their sharp contradictions,
          greatly undermined his leadership, and the ardor of his attendants
          was visibly damp<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg
          241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>ened. A few secretly cursed the day upon which
          they joined the crusade. That aforetime unfaltering hero, who with
          iron will had inspired them in former days, was broken, and almost
          feeble. Courage alternated with violent and foolish fears. He heard
          pursuers upon his track, and saw faces and Shapes that were
          unshared in the experience of his comrades. Fierce outbursts of the
          spirit of persecution were followed by fits of moaning and weeping.
          When he came out of his trances, he was at a loss to know whether
          he had been out of the body or in the body.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seemed as
          though Titanic forces within the soul of Saulus were battling for
          its possession, with varying victory and defeat. What direction
          will this tremendous soul-force finally take? An Inner Spirit was
          expanding which threatened to burst the bonds and standards of the
          outer world. Education, religion, custom, and ceremonial obligation
          quivered in the balance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The beautiful
          city of the East was now in the immediate foreground. But with all
          its loveliness, it stood forth as the embodiment of <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">continued persecution
          and death</span></span>. That shaft pierced between the joints of
          the soul’s armor and went home. Saulus was struck through and
          through by a shock of spiritual electricity. The overstrained
          tension of the bond which held him to the Old snapped under the
          stress of the terrible vision.<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such was the
          exclamation of Amabel, as for the first time she looked upon the
          deep blue Mediterranean.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sun was just
          about to hide himself below the rim of the boundless mirror-like
          expanse of water, as the newly wedded pair seated themselves upon
          one of the house-tops of Cæsarea.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Their journey
          from Jerusalem had been taken by easy stages, and two hours before
          they had arrived at the new seaport which had been built by Herod
          the Great, and named for his imperial master at Rome.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here, where
          threescore years before there had been but an insignificant
          fishing-town with no harbor, now stood the imposing capital of
          Judea, with a commerce of no mean proportions. Besides the spacious
          and pretentious Herodian palace, there was a temple dedicated to
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“divine Cæsar,”</span> a theatre,
          amphitheatre, and other public buildings, which gave it the aspect
          of a metropolis. The harbor had been artificially constructed at
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name=
          "Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>enormous expense by
          Roman skill and enterprise under Herod’s direction. He caused
          immense blocks of stone to be brought from a long distance, and
          sunk to the depth of twenty fathoms, forming a semi-circular mole,
          protected from the south and west, with a narrow entrance on the
          north, within which ships could find secure anchorage and
          refuge.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The strong hand
          of Rome reached out in every direction during the days of her
          imperial greatness, and her works, marvellous in their extent and
          solidity, reached almost to the <span class="tei tei-q">“ends of
          the earth.”</span> Far outlasting the conquests of her panoplied
          legions and the sweep of her civil authority, her massive bridges,
          roads, harbors, palaces, and towers formed enduring monuments of a
          material greatness, unique in human history. What might she not
          have accomplished had not corruption, sensuality, and cruelty, like
          gnawing worms, eaten out her very heart and life, leaving her a
          gilded sepulchre?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Absorbed by the
          picturesque charm and unwonted variety of the scenery about them,
          Serenus and Amabel sat for some time silent, while feasting their
          souls upon its richness. Behind them, to the north and east, were
          the green, wide-stretching slopes of Mount Carmel, with vineyards
          and olive-groves, softened by a purple haze which seemed like a
          mystical benediction—the parting gift of day.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The endless
          expanse of the great sea before them was so calm in its unruffled
          peacefulness that it seemed to be sleeping upon the bosom of the
          Infinite. The warm and dreamy atmosphere was laden with the perfume
          of gardens, which skirted the shore and climbed the
          hill-<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name=
          "Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sides, while their
          dark green foliage, with blossoms of many hues, was reflected with
          a gentle quiver in the neighboring deeps. The inspiration of the
          scene justified the feeling that God dwells with and in men, and
          that his Spirit and Life shine through all material things, even
          though unrecognized, save by those whose eyes have been opened to
          the higher and deeper vision of the Real.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few fishermen
          were lazily rowing their light craft homeward, while others, who
          had already landed, were hanging their nets upon the cliffs to dry.
          In the distance the shrill tones of the shepherd’s pipe calling his
          flock, the varying vibrations of bird-notes, and the hum of
          insects, rounded out the delicious harmony of sound and sight. At
          length the sun disappeared, and the radiant afterglow seemed to
          transform the sea into a great pearl, whose ever-changing
          opalescence gradually deepened as evening drew on.</p>

          interpretation? What sayest thou of the Greeks, who worship Nature,
          and vainly imagine that they hear her many voices? Are they not
          corrupt and deluded?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          aspiration after God, who is beneficent and universal, but rather
          an homage paid to blind, discordant, and warring forces, which are
          but the reflection of the lower and sensuous thoughts of the
          worshipper. The love of the beautiful in the Greek is a wholesome
          element in itself, but it is concerned mainly with appearances,
          rather than with the divine love which is articulated through them.
          Outward forms are but shadows, and he who doth not look through and
          beyond them is unable to translate their low, sweet
          language.”</span></p>

          the sorrowing, she is sad; and to the joyful, a delight. Even
          though the base may see some comeliness in her graceful forms, yet

          to their delectable vision upon the house-top, and descended again
          to mingle with their kind, and minister to human necessity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus had
          expected to find some vessel at Cæsarea bound directly for Italy,
          which would land at Puteoli or Brundusium, from either of which
          ports the journey to Rome would be made by land. But upon
          ascertaining that there was no immediate prospect for such an
          opportunity, and that the Salapiæ, a merchantman of good repute,
          was already laden for Tarsus, and to sail on the following day, he
          decided to embark for the Cilician capital. They would remain there
          for a time, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg
          252]</span><a name="Pg252" id="Pg252" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>until they were minded to take the rest of the
          proposed journey.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tarsus, being a
          great metropolis, the seat of important schools of learning, and
          the meeting-place of many peoples and races, might prove a fertile
          field for sowing the seed of the New Faith. Amabel entered heartily
          into the plan. Though the birthplace of Saulus, it was beyond the
          reach of the Judean persecutions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Salapiæ was
          a Phœnician vessel, commanded by a Roman named Vivian, of favorable
          reputation and experience. She was staunch and large, having a
          tonnage of about eight hundred tons, and rigged after the Phœnician
          pattern, with a ponderous mast carrying a very large mainsail upon
          a long yard. A much smaller triangular foresail was rigged upon a
          bowsprit, which projected over the stem of the vessel forward. She
          carried various carved images and symbols designed to insure the
          favor of the gods, including a finely wrought Grecian statue of a
          favorite goddess, which was placed upon the stem-post at the
          bow.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hour for
          setting sail arrived, and everything betokened a prosperous voyage.
          The decks were noisy with the final bustle of preparation, and with
          much effort the heavy anchors were weighed and secured in their
          places. A light favoring breeze was blowing from the south, and at
          length a lusty command rang out to <span class="tei tei-q">“hoist
          all sail;”</span> and soon the canvas began to fill, and the good
          ship drew steadily away upon her northward course.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus and
          Amabel stood upon the upper deck, and with mingled emotions looked
          back upon the picturesque shore of Samaria which was slowly
          receding. Though <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg
          253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>exiles from the Holy City, the world was
          before them, and they were happy. Without the enjoyment of freedom
          of soul, even native land was but a prison.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day wore
          away, the white towers and roofs of Cæsarea faded from sight, and
          the bold range of Mount Carmel, which formed the rim of the eastern
          horizon, grew dim and distant.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The voyage was
          pleasant and uneventful, and upon the fourth day they made the
          harbor of Salamis on the eastern end of the island of Cyprus, where
          vessels from the south usually touched on the way to Tarsus. This
          was a large commercial city, made especially conspicuous by its
          important temple of the Salaminian Jupiter. Beyond the temple and
          city was a rich plain, encircled by hills, and watered by the
          abundant streams of Pediæus. As in other cities where the Jews of
          the Dispersion had settled, there were several synagogues. During
          the day, over which the Salapiæ remained, Serenus visited two or
          three of them, making known the New Faith, and restoring some
          sick-folk through the orderly working of the divine power within
          him. He was cordially received by the more liberal of the
          Hellenistic Jews, and they were sorrowful at his departure.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Early the next
          morning the Salapiæ again set sail, and it was expected that, with
          favoring winds, Tarsus would be reached on the third day.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Everything went
          well until after they had rounded the point of the promontory of
          Dinaretum, at the northeastern extremity of the island, when with
          almost no warning, the vessel was suddenly struck by a tempest of
          great violence, throwing her nearly upon her beam-ends. It
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name=
          "Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>came with so little
          premonition that the sailors had barely begun to lower the great
          clumsy mainsail when it was rent in twain by the force of the wind.
          This eased the vessel except for a list to the leeward, caused by
          the shifting of the cargo. Shrieks, cries, imprecations, and
          prayers to the gods were mingled with the roar of the storm. So
          great was the panic that the master found it difficult to maintain
          any semblance of order among a crew which was made up of a mixture
          of different races and tongues.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The air was
          thick with blinding spray, and the stricken ship, like a wounded
          animal, staggered onward, laboring and straining in the boiling
          sea. Heavy waves washed the decks, and the soaking mass of
          shattered canvas swung to and fro, its tattered shreds no longer
          resisting the wind, which howled through them with a thunderous
          roar.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By Hercules!”</span> quoth master Vivian; <span class=

          "font-style: italic">must</span></span> come, the gods were
          merciful in rending the sail, else she would have foundered at the
          first stroke!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tempest was
          not an <span class="tei tei-q">“Elisian,”</span> as certain gales
          from the northwest were designated in the Levant, but blew from the
          southeast, from which quarter it finally settled into a steady
          gale.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The immediate
          danger seemed to be past.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The remnants of
          the mainsail were gradually cleared away, and the Salapiæ scudded
          before the wind, under bare poles, with the exception of the
          closely reefed foresail, which somewhat steadied her. After the
          decks were cleared of rubbish, all hands were put to work to right
          the cargo, which was done with great difficulty. The <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hoarse roar of the gale continued
          unbroken. It came from a little to the east of south, which was in
          a direction to drive them directly toward their destination, and
          there was plenty of sea room which was much in their favor. For
          their escape the gods were thanked in various tongues, libations
          poured, and the commotion, which had been so noisy, was
          quieted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But anon a cry
          came up from the lower hold that the Salapiæ was leaking. The first
          terrible strain of the great mainmast had opened some of the seams,
          and they were taking water. Once more there was despair upon the
          faces of the bravest-hearted sailors. The gods of all grades were
          again invoked, and vows renewed. But the master believed in works
          as well as petitions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Bring out the cables!”</span> he cried. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“She must be undergirded!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With great labor
          a cable was slipped down over the bow, being held from each side,
          and passed under and back until it encircled the hull amidships,
          and then another, and both were strained and fastened as snugly as
          possible over the deck. It was a vain effort. If it prevented a
          further opening, it did not stop the leak. The pumps were put in
          motion with frequent relays.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon the
          eventful day came to an end, and the darkness of night closed
          around them. The bellowing wind held from the same quarter with no
          diminution, and the speed, even with little canvas spread, was
          rapid. If the leak gained upon the pumps, the only safety lay in
          making Tarsus, and therefore the small amount of sail was then
          increased as much as it would bear, and the Salapiæ swept on before
          the wind.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg
          256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amidst all the
          confusion of tongues and conflict of elements, Serenus remained
          calm and unmoved. Amabel was at first disturbed, but after some
          reassuring words from her husband, she remained quietly in the
          cabin, performing such little services for the overworked and
          panic-stricken sailors as were possible for the delicate hands of a
          woman. A part of the time Serenus was at her side, and at intervals
          he went out upon deck to speak words of encouragement to officers
          and men.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The master sent
          the second officer below to make reports concerning the progress of
          the leak. There was intense anxiety to learn whether the Salapiæ
          were settling, or if the pumps were equal to the inflow.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Two cubita,”</span> came up in hollow but distinct
          tones from below.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An hour then
          wearily passed, with the relay at the pumps doing their utmost.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Two cubita and one-eighth!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the report
          came to his ear through a small aperture from below, the face of
          Vivian lost color; but despite the news he went over to the pumps

          he; and then passing along, he ordered a part of the crew to begin
          at once to throw the cargo overboard. He said nothing of the report
          from below, but the significance of the last order was understood
          by all. Over the slippery, reeling decks they began with a will to
          unload the Salapiæ.</p>

          the curtain which veils the future, in varying degree, has come to
          a rare soul, here and there, in all ages. But more properly it is
          not a favor, specially bestowed from without, but a supernal
          attainment <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">within</span></span>,—an unwonted spiritual
          altitude. The prophetic instinct lies deeply embedded in the soul
          of man, but few there be who can strip away the thick coverings of
          sense, so as to read the direction of the delicate needle of the
          spiritual compass. Such a power is no miracle in the sense of a
          change or improved action on the part of the Unchangeable
          Perfection, but an orderly lifting of the soul into a close
          communion with It,—the Divine Mind. Through spiritual law,
          steadfast in its regularity,—of which the world at large has yet
          had but fitful glimpses,—events not only distant, but of the
          future, are clearly laid open to highly attuned souls. History,

          night.</p>

          them not. The peril which threatened every soul on board steadily
          increased—but he knew it not. His animate form reclined in the
          little room, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          at the prospect. His pale face, dark sunken eyes, trembling nerves,
          and evident weakness of body and limb, spoke eloquently of extreme
          feebleness. Yet, as he gazed forward, a new light came into his
          eyes, as if a strong soul would spur on its frame, and command it
          to live. It was Saulus!<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href=

          mounted upon a well-laden camel, while his companion walked by his
          side. Hardly able to keep his hold against the swaying motion of
          the animal, he clung as with the grasp of desperation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A shallow stream
          may easily be turned in a new direction, but to change the course
          of one whose flashing current is deep and swift is a herculean
          transaction. It must tear away much material—rock, soil,
          vegetation, and even trees by the roots, transforming them into
          washed and swept <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">débris</span></span>—before it can adjust
          itself to new banks, and scour another channel. So a great soul
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name=
          "Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of vehement force is
          an impetuous psychological river, the reversal of which, if it be
          sudden, produces a spiritual cataclysm.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If an eagle of
          powerful and sweeping wing be met in his swift course, and drenched
          and battered by an opposing storm of irresistible force, he must
          needs alight a while upon solid ground, and through some quiet
          recuperation plume his spent and drooping pinions before again
          soaring aloft.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The world has
          witnessed few greater transactions than the transformation of
          Saulus. No material conquest, and no physical change in the face of
          nature, can be compared with the reversal and resurrection of a
          great mind. Well may it be called a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“miracle,”</span> if the old illogical but common
          definition of the term be superseded by one that is orderly and
          rational. Miracles are lawful, not lawless. They are circles, of
          which an important arc is above the limited range of the ordinary
          observer. They are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">super</span></span>natural, in the sense of
          being above the material and sensuous comprehension, but not
          violations or suspensions of the universal Divine Order. The Author
          of all things is never disorderly in his methods.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
          psychological realm, as in the physical, while there is a
          conservation of energy, there are also alternations of action and
          reaction. When a great soul has <span class="tei tei-q">“passed
          through fire and water,”</span> a condition of passivity and
          silence naturally follows. When the black clouds that have been
          rolled together by a great tempest have dissolved, the torrents
          ceased, and the thunder died away, then is sunlit nature unwontedly
          calm and peace<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg

          storm remain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus, sick at
          heart and wrenched in body, yearned for solitude. It was an
          imperative necessity. As a stricken deer by positive instinct
          leaves the herd, so he must step out from the surrounding human
          current. Rest, quiet, stillness! at any sacrifice! He was like a
          tree which had been pulled up by the roots. His wounds must have
          time to heal, and the torn fibres and tendrils be soothed,
          refreshed, and readjusted. If the foundations of a lifetime have
          been swept away, there must be new excavation and bed-rock
          replacement. The life of Saulus had been a tempestuous current of
          destruction to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Nazarenes.”</span> Now
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          attendants who had accompanied Saulus to Damascus, but one remained
          faithful to him. Some of them thought him suddenly mad, and others
          were minded to take him back to Jerusalem under arrest. Their
          counsels were confused and came to naught. But Amoz, the companion
          of his former disturbed nights in the Holy City, though having but
          little appreciation of his great change, remained personally loyal,
          and was willing to go with him for a time, even in the wilderness.
          He sympathized with his infirmities, and was tender in
          ministration.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was well
          along in the afternoon, after the midday rest, during the terrible
          heat of the desert air, that the two travellers started on the last
          stage of their wearisome journey. A great arid sand-waste stretched
          away on both sides of the narrow trail, with here and there a few
          hardy shrubs and wiry yellow grasses which were <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>stirred by the fitful summer air. As
          they advanced towards the foothills of the mountain range, the
          landscape became more broken by the numerous wadies which were worn
          by the torrential mountain streams of the rainy season, and there
          was an increased luxuriance of vegetation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Sinaitic
          peninsula is interesting both on account of its topographical
          peculiarities, and historically in its association with the giving
          of the Law, and other events which are recorded of the wanderings
          of the Children of Israel in the Wilderness. Between the gulfs of
          Suez and Akaba, this bold mass of mountains, lying south of the
          great desert of Ettyh Paran, projects itself well into the Red
          Sea.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was
          thoroughly apart from all the world’s highways, cities, and towns—a
          veritable corner of the earth, surrounded by sea and desert. Its
          lofty reddish-brown frowning peaks looked down upon a vast
          solitude. They were generally precipitous, having many fissures,
          hollows and caves around their bases, forming a shelter from the
          heat of the sun, and convenient even for dwelling-places most of
          the year. Amid these mountains, hermits anchorites and pilgrims
          found a lonely resort fitted to their desires.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the
          travellers went on, the ground was more broken, the valleys deeper,
          and the tangled reeds and grasses greener and more varied. The
          trail led into a wide, shallow wady, the bed of which was still
          soft from recent rains, and as they toiled along the slow ascent
          the verdure thickened. An occasional oleander in bloom, tangles of
          climbing vines, scattered mulberry-trees, with <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>here and there a palm, now gladdened
          their sight, in marked contrast to the barren wilderness which they
          had left behind. They soon found themselves among low bluffs and
          cliffs, with here and there a tiny stream of clear water springing
          from the cracks of the fissured rocks.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The whistle of
          quail and the whir of partridges, with the song of the lark and
          rock-sparrow, greeted their ears, and other birds of various hues
          uttered their notes and flew away as they were startled from their
          reedy coverts. Anon a sly fox or frightened jackal was seen
          galloping in the distance. They had emerged from heat, bareness,
          and deadness into the region of living things. The sun was
          declining, and the cooler air, with a great change in the face of
          nature, gave Saulus some increase of strength and hope.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length a
          beseeching moan from the patient dromedary reminded them that the
          end of day was near, and that the hour for encampment and rest had
          come. Soon a gentle decline of dry, grassy ground was at hand. Amoz
          gave the camel the signal to kneel, and then carefully supported
          Saulus in his arms as he dismounted. He had little strength left,
          but yet his eyes, which had been fixed and dreamy during the day,
          kindled at the new and more inspiring surroundings, and the
          prospect of much-needed repose. Amoz deftly spread a soft carpet
          upon the grass, and tenderly placed Saulus upon it, where he could
          recline while the preparations for the night’s encampment were
          being made.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the ship is
          to the sea, so is the camel to the desert, and his noiseless
          stepping and rhythmical careen<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>ing make the likeness a striking one. The full
          load and equipment of the awkward brute embraced all the endless
          variety of necessities for nomadic life. Boxes and bundles were
          hung over his broad back and secured by straps and girths, so that
          everything was snug and convenient. The harness included some color
          and embellishment, the bridle being trimmed with scarlet fringe,
          and upon the throat-strap was hung a row of tiny tinkling bells,
          besides other trappings, knots, and variegated ties, which made up
          a picturesque combination. Pride, care, and even affection are
          lavished upon the faithful beast, without whose aid life and travel
          in the desert would be well-nigh impossible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From among the
          paraphernalia which formed the dromedary cargo, Amoz drew a large
          circular camel’s-hair cloth, with a bundle of rods and a light
          strong pole. The frame was joined and the pole planted, and with
          the cloth fastened over them, a tent, small, but ample for a person
          to stand upright in, was soon constructed. This, with the grassy
          carpet beneath and other accessories, formed a nomadic home quite
          complete for the air of Arabia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From pouches and
          willow baskets Amoz brought forth materials for a meal. There were
          dried and smoked meats, dates, pomegranates, wheaten wafers, honey,
          cheese made from goat’s milk, and wine in skin gurglets. These,
          with fresh water from a near-by spring in the cliff, made a
          comfortable repast. The camel was groomed, and given a store of
          water, of which, for three days past, the desert had not afforded a
          drop.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The moist
          freshness of the air and neighboring ani<span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class=

          was near his journey’s end, stirred some new life in the veins of
          the sore and bruised Saulus, and for the first time in years there
          seemed to be nourishment and rejoicing in his immediate
          environment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sun was
          slowly sinking in the western horizon, his parting beams
          brilliantly lighting up the deep-red and purplish summits and
          cliffs of Sinai, which were now in near and full view. As Saulus
          gazed upon them they seemed almost instinct with life and weird
          mystery. Especially the towering heights of Horeb were eloquent
          with ancient sacred story. The great cluster of lesser peaks stood
          up like gigantic living witnesses of distant events, and brought
          them near. When in times gone by Saulus had read the records of the
          scenes which here had transpired, they seemed dead and formal, but
          now they teemed with life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Darkness drew
          on, and with crowns newly silvered by the rising moon, these great
          silent sentinels told anew their mute story. Was <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">I am</span></span>”</span> here? He who
          had led the Children through this land, who handed down the Law to
          them, whose thunderings made them tremble and whose lightnings
          terrified them? The Past is a part of the Present. If <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">I am that I am</span></span>”</span>
          dwelt here of old, he is not less present now. And those great
          souls, Moses and Elijah, who aforetime trod these solitudes, gazed
          upon these cliffs, and tabernacled in Horeb—do they, unseen by the
          eye of sense, ever revisit these scenes?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Do the
          generations which follow each other in quick succession repeat in
          endless round the same experi<span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          the same obstacles, or do they learn new lessons, make fresh
          advances, and dwell upon higher levels? Is the ancient code of
          stern legality, the close mechanical limitations of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thou shalt not,”</span> to be gradually set aside by
          the true ideal of a positive spiritual freedom, faith, love, and
          good works?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the shades of
          evening thickly gathered, Saulus looked up towards the shining
          firmament which testified to the infinite and unchangeable
          perfection of the Divine. Surely, God and his ways can neither
          improve nor grow old; but the seeming alteration in his dealings
          with the children of men must be in their own varying moods and
          short range of vision. Here his meditation was suddenly
          interrupted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was seized
          with his nightly trembling fit, with its usual accompaniment of
          direful fears, forebodings, and tragic visions of the past. Every
          evening brought a recurrence of these nervous spasms, which rudely
          broke in upon him at the same hour, regardless of how he might be
          occupied. His agony was fearful to behold. With loud groans he
          cried out to the living God for forgiveness and release.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O God, spare me! Cleanse me from this awful
          blood-guiltiness! O Jesus of Nazareth, have mercy!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There trooped in
          terrible procession before his mind the forms and faces of many
          innocent ones whom he had scourged and tortured. In the chill of a
          cold perspiration he cried out and implored that his eyes might be
          closed against a repetition of the scenes of the Holy City, but
          nothing could shut them out. With contortion <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of face, shaking of limb, and agony of
          soul, at length he sank, from thorough exhaustion into enforced
          quietude. After gradually reviving and recovering, he remained
          free, until the next evening again ushered in the same terrible
          experience.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amoz faithfully
          ministered to the necessities of Saulus, tenderly soothing him with
          brotherly sympathy, until long-sought quietude settled upon the
          little tent for the night.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The deep scars
          of sin and crime only can be healed by slow growth. The well-worn
          thought-channels of a mind which has done violence to laws of its
          own divine being cannot be filled and levelled by any sudden change
          of belief or doctrinal transformation. Well would it be for the
          world, if once it could be convinced that cause and effect can no
          more be severed upon the psychical and spiritual planes than in the
          material realm. There is no short cut or evasion in the moral
          economy. Nothing on earth can put away a state of consciousness in
          man but the growth of a different one, which only may gradually and
          lawfully displace it. It cannot be driven out forcibly or quickly.
          Character is formed of thought-habits, and their exercise and
          dominance give them ever increasing rigidity. A renewing of the
          mind consists of its activity projected into a higher realm. When
          the leading trend <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg
          271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
          a soul is discordant with the divine order and primal love, the
          outcome is sure to be a moral wrench difficult to repair.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The early
          morning sun again gilded the brown and deep-red peaks of Sinai, and
          Amoz was up betimes to prepare the simple morning meal, and make
          ready for the remaining short journey.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The high ground
          upon which they had encamped afforded a wide view to the eastward,
          and the sweet and moist morning air and dewy freshness made the
          broad expanse seem like a newly discovered paradise. In the
          distance the broad blue Gulf of Akaba reflected the golden beams of
          the rising orb of day, gleaming like a great opalescent sea of
          pearl, while in the dim purple distance beyond arose the misty
          Arabian peaks which skirt its farther shore. The morning was a
          benediction, and the world seemed peaceful and good. Nature glowed
          with life and cheer, and the early lights and shadows capriciously
          chased each other up and down the mountain-slopes in unending
          procession. The cloud-forms which gracefully floated over the grim
          summits seemed to correspond, in their fleeting evanescence, to the
          passing generations of men which these silent rock-ribbed witnesses
          had looked down upon, as if they had been a slow-moving but endless
          caravan.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Is anything in
          the universe fixed and enduring? Yea, the immortal life of man! He
          whose material existence is like the flitting cloud-shadows
          possesses a real selfhood that will expand and develop when yonder
          solid peaks shall have dissolved to dust and found their lowest
          level.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus felt new
          strength and inspiration from the breath and fragrance of Nature
          that smiled upon him. The beautiful surroundings, or rather the
          great exuberant Life which pulsated through them, seemed to warm
          his soul, and cause a bursting forth of the inmost springs of his
          nature. The hard, formal religiosity, which like an unyielding
          shell had long encased him, was beginning to soften and gradually
          disintegrate before the force of the new spiritual current in his
          soul.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the
          morning meal was finished, and the camel had been fed, groomed, and
          harnessed, the light tent was struck, and it, with the other
          paraphernalia, loaded upon him, they started, Saulus riding in his
          place, and Amoz walking, as was his wont. Two or three hours more
          and they would be at the foot of Horeb,—their journey’s end. Why
          were they going there? Amoz had often put this question to Saulus,
          but no response had been offered. He did not refuse to answer from
          any unwillingness, but was unable to divine any definite plan even
          to himself. Something seemed to draw him. Was it blind fate? Nay!
          he was guided by a spiritual instinct, strong but gentle, soft
          though unerring. He could not fathom it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the time of
          leaving Damascus, through all the weary days in the terrible
          desert, there had been no wavering nor uncertainty. Unseen guidance
          shaped the pilgrimage in every detail, mysterious even to its chief
          actor. A path opened before him, and he felt drawn to follow its
          devious winding. While he had a general purpose, he felt that its
          definite unfoldment was provided for by that which was superior to
          himself. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg
          273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>He
          desired to go for a season beyond the haunts of men, and to breathe
          the pure air of heaven, but the particulars were plainly none of
          his. Could it be a divine guidance? He had always believed that the
          orderings of Jehovah came through outward signs, thunderings and
          miracles. An earthquake or a tempest might have been interpreted.
          But what of this still, gentle influence within him? What could
          move a soul which had been the noisy arena of warring forces and
          tumults? But this seemed to well up from the very depths of his
          being. Could it be God?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Had a line been
          stretched all the way from Damascus for him to follow he would have
          gone no more unerringly, but yet, mystery though it were, he felt
          subject to no pressure.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How many souls
          have vainly sought the world over to find the Infinite,—the
          Universal Good,—and have finally discovered him in their inmost
          nature! They have delved through history, roamed over continents,
          visited holy places, searched through creeds, scanned philosophies,
          sounded the depths of ecclesiasticism, traversed the circumference
          of systems and institutions, and bowed to the authority of priest
          and ritual, only to discover at last the divinity of the real
          selfhood,—that inner light which is set for the teaching of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“every man, coming into the world.”</span>
          How many have looked high and low, and cried, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lo here”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Lo
          there,”</span> who needed only thorough self-interpretation! How
          many inmost and potential <span class="tei tei-q">“sons of
          God,”</span> through the misdirection of the imaging or creative
          faculty of soul, have unwittingly cast their own shadows as sons of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name=
          "Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Belial, and thereby
          accepted the dominance of evil! How many, through the glamour of a
          formal and institutional plan of salvation, have unconsciously
          covered the hidden and normal divinity of humanity! How many,
          through an artificial and abnormal humility, have rated themselves
          as <span class="tei tei-q">“poor miserable sinners,”</span> and as
          a natural consequence been subtly drawn, through a moral pessimism,
          toward the outline of their own specification!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two hours of
          early morning travel brought Saulus and Amoz to the rock-ribbed
          base of Mount Horeb. The cooling shade of trees and shrubs, the
          fresh fragrant air, and the grand outlook as they came upon the
          still more elevated ground at the foot of the great cliff, gave
          Saulus a strange sense of detachment from the earth. He felt an
          unwonted spiritual upliftment and exhilaration which was a
          revelation. The surrounding sweetness, the silence, broken only by
          the song and twitter of an occasional bird, descended like a
          healing balm upon the stained and scarred soul of the erstwhile
          inquisitor.</p>

          <span class="tei tei-q">“Mount of God,”</span> firm and
          unchangeable, looked down with mystical and compassionate dignity,
          as if to bear witness to the touch of things eternal; to invest the
          soul of the observer with a divine awe, perchance again to unroll
          for the instruction of Saulus the great Drama of the Chosen
          People.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The narrow trail
          which had been followed the day before had gradually faded out or
          lost itself in various <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg
          275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>disused paths which branched in different
          directions, and now the twain found themselves close against the
          precipitous side of the mountain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Verily we must turn to the right or the left,”</span>
          said Amoz, <span class="tei tei-q">“for we can go no farther. But
          here is a cool and shady thicket. Let us go beneath its shelter and
          rest a while.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Guiding the
          camel skilfully, they threaded their way into the clump of
          blossoming oleanders and mulberry-trees, soon coming to a mass of
          clinging vines which concealed the face of the great overhanging
          cliff in front. Amoz helped Saulus to alight, and the faithful
          beast uttered a cry of joy as he awkwardly kneeled for the removal
          of his load. The equipments were soon unladen, and there was a
          feeling that the long, wearisome journey was at an end. In the
          midst of such verdure and freshness the toilsome days in the desert
          seemed only like a troublesome dream which had almost faded out.
          The face of Saulus brightened, the dark rings around his eyes were
          less heavy, and he felt some increase of strength.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The mysterious Voice which speaks within me still
          commands, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Go forward!’</span> ”</span>
          said Saulus.</p>

          "tei tei-q">“But, O my brother, we are close against the Mount! How

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amoz left Saulus
          for a moment, and carefully made his way through the tangle, to spy
          out, if possible, the immediate foreground. He brushed aside the
          climbing vines, and found himself face to face with the solid
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name=
          "Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rock. He was just
          about to turn back, when his eyes rested upon something which had
          the general form of ancient Hebrew text. The lapse of ages, with
          the moist atmosphere, had well nigh covered it with a luxurious
          growth of velvety mosses, but he could not be mistaken.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The hand of man hath wrought this!”</span> he
          exclaimed to himself; and without waiting to make any further
          examination he hurried to inform Saulus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold, O Saulus! the cliff hath been graven by the
          hand of man!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I will go with thee, and peradventure we may give it
          interpretation!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As it was close
          at hand, Saulus, with the assistance of his companion, found no
          difficulty in working his way through the vines to the impenetrable
          barrier of stone. Amoz quickly cleared away the tangle, and then
          stripping off the mossy hangings, an inscription stood before them
          in bold, deeply engraved Hebrew characters,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style=
          "margin-bottom: 1.00em; text-align: center"><span class="tei tei-q"

          "text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 75%">GOD IS
          HERE</span></span>.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus and Amoz
          instinctively removed their sandals, and bowed their faces to the
          ground. They felt a Presence surrounding them. The place was holy
          ground. The very trees, vines, and leaves seemed to breathe forth a
          fragrant benediction. To the inner eye they glowed with brightness
          and were not consumed. After a season of silent adoration they
          arose and reverently made further examination. They found other
          carvings and symbols, mystical in form, which they were unable to
          interpret.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Of a surety, the Voice which guided us hither is

          "Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>none other than the
          Voice of God!”</span> said Saulus. <span class="tei tei-q">“In the
          fulness of time it will make everything plain!”</span> he continued
          with confidence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yea, I also am persuaded that thy footsteps have been
          divinely led to the Holy Mount. Here we will tabernacle until thou
          hast recovered thy strength.”</span></p>

          "tei tei-q">“I am already stronger! The Voice will guide and help
          me! Behold, I have found God!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His eye kindled
          with a new light, and his features were suffused with an unwonted
          vigor and life. He trembled, not with the fulness of fear, as in
          the nightly spasms, but with a thrill of joy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">O wondrous
          mountain! O wondrous world that pulsates with the breath of God! O
          mystery of mysteries! God meets men face to face!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Reverently
          brushing back more of the tangle, and carefully removing the
          velvety covering, they beheld another inscription,—</p>

          "text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 75%">GOD IS ETERNAL
          LOVE AND LIFE</span></span>.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus was
          lifted to the supremacy and sublimity of a new, triumphant faith.
          He felt the sweet certainty of something nobler and purer than he
          had ever conceived; a gladness that nestled in his heart, making it
          warm and tranquil. He had no favor to ask or petition to make of
          the Divinity which embraced him, for his soul was filled—satisfied.
          There was no lack. Enswathed in the Eternal Presence, he could
          crave no more.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every branch and
          twig and leaf seemed to be tipped with a lambent, gleaming light
          which shone upon him. The whole Vision smiled, and the Voice gave
          him a wel<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg
          278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>come, until with bated breath and throbbing
          heart he had a sense of leaving the body, and rising and being
          encircled by a golden aureole.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With eyes
          upturned, the bodily form of Saulus sank quietly back until he lay
          stretched upon the soft, mossy couch beneath him. The seen world
          faded out amidst the uprearing of a transcendent ecstasy.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amoz sat by his
          side, wondering at the experiences of the great soul which he had
          seen so variously possessed. A smile played upon the upturned face
          of Saulus as he lay, calm and unconscious, in the cooling shade.
          Was there a prophetic gleam of future power and glory? Was there
          some dim foretaste of an Apostolic energy, which should reach, not
          merely one race, but possess a moulding influence upon the world?
          Had he been carried up in a Chariot of Fire to an altitude where he
          could look out over the Future, and rapturously behold the activity
          of unseen forces and intelligences, through whose final triumph the
          kingdom of universal love and harmony—that at-one-ment of the
          Divine and Human—is to be ushered in?</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length Saulus
          opened his eyes and sat upright. He said nothing of the Vision, for
          it was unspeakable.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hand in hand
          Saulus and Amoz stood up and drew nearer to the great rocky Breast,
          which reached almost perpendicularly far up beyond the range of
          their vision. Again they essayed to decipher and interpret the
          mys<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name=
          "Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>terious signs and
          symbols which were clustered about the plain sentences already
          read, but in vain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then they
          noticed a peculiar series of small characters, which extended to
          the right, behind the tangle. Following its lead, and carefully
          clearing away the vines and leaves which covered its farther
          course, there was soon revealed a great cleft in the rock. It
          seemed to lead directly into the heart of mighty Horeb, and was
          broad enough to admit a laden camel. A light, cool breeze was
          issuing from within, and the entrance was smooth, dry, and
          inviting.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With an eager
          and expectant air the two young Hebrews entered side by side, and
          were soon beyond the light of the outer world.</p>

          halting to encourage the sailors, or direct in the movement of some
          heavy piece of the cargo which was to be cast overboard, to
          lighten, so far as possible, the stricken ship. The shrill creaking
          of the pumps, as they were unceasingly worked in the prevailing
          darkness, sounded as might the sighs and moans of malignant fiends,
          who were derisively gloating over the rich prey of which they
          already felt sure.</p>

          "tei tei-q">“Two cubita and a half!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The gods be merciful!”</span> he exclaimed to himself.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Nothing less than their interposition can
          save us!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hoarse
          vibrations of the surrounding tempest were <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>mingled with its shriller tones produced by
          its hissing sweep through the shattered spars and rigging, all
          combining, like the different instruments in a great orchestra, to
          render a grand minor symphony of Woe and Despair.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By great
          exertion they were able to raise a little more canvas, as the only
          hope lay in making Tarsus, or some other port on the Cilician
          coast, toward which the wind was sweeping them. Though much more
          distant than Salamis, which they had left behind, there was no
          choice. They could go only where they were driven. The gods were
          invoked and libations poured, that the gale, which at first had
          brought them disaster, might continue. Could they make Tarsus
          before the Salapiæ would fill and go to the bottom?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The panic and
          confusion which had prevailed among the crew of many races
          gradually subsided, and a grim desperation settled down upon all.
          Each worked with a dogged, sullen intensity, as though the fate of
          all depended upon his own persistency of effort.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To actually face
          death sometimes seems to inspire a kind of stolid indifference.
          Even to the ignorant and worldly man the vital fact comes home that
          it can come but once, and that, after all, the peculiar time and
          means of the most universal of all human experiences are not so
          very important. The divine economy of the human constitution is
          such that when the great Fact looms up in the near foreground,
          there is often an unwonted serenity and confidence that are lacking
          in lesser trials, or even in its own more distant anticipation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Deep down
          beneath the perturbed and noisy surface <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>of human consciousness there is an inherent
          and instinctive faith in, and recognition of, the righteousness and
          even beneficence of that which Is and Must Be. Only a merciful
          Providence could have provided that the life-long fear of meeting
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“King of Terrors”</span> should
          measurably fade out upon his near approach.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever may
          betide, every man feels, in the profound recesses of his heart,
          that he will be justly dealt with, and that the natural penalty for
          his misdeeds should not be shunned, and that perhaps in some way it
          is well that it should come. The artificial, dogmatic, and
          superficial elements drop away, and a divinely implanted
          subconscious sense of universal equity, and even love, finally
          comes to the surface and makes itself felt.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Man feels that
          he is to be fairly weighed, and will inevitably find his own moral
          and spiritual specific gravity. The universe is so ordered that he
          will invariably measure himself, for it is best that he should. He
          that is condemned is self-condemned. True, he regrets his own
          manifold mistakes, selfishness, and sensuous degradation. Their
          penalties will surely scarify him, and make up his beneficent hell,
          through which he must pass, either here or hereafter, in order to
          purification. Metals are only purged of their dross by being cast
          into the crucible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Salvation must
          be the result of free moral character, and that must grow from
          within, for it cannot be imposed. This fundamental principle
          underlies all surface religions, dogmatisms, and systems.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Salapiæ
          plunged dizzily onward. Amid the swash of waves upon the deck, and
          the swinging to and fro of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>the tattered remnants of sails which kept time
          to her staggering rhythm, a few dim, moving lanterns, like fitful
          fireflies, were all that could be discerned.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Vivian never
          lost courage and composure, though he recognized that the race
          between the leak and Tarsus included only a bare possibility of
          reaching the latter, the probabilities being an hundred-fold in
          favor of the former.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was past
          midnight when Serenus emerged from the little cabin where he had
          been in the silence—with the Universal. His mien was calm and
          confident, and his face radiant with a sense of inner reserve and
          spiritual upliftment. He first sought Amabel, who was patiently
          awaiting him. There was no trace of care on her beautiful face, and
          she greeted him with a warm embrace.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          the Tester, or negative Developer, of man. But for trials and

          of an experience in which the Adversary had an important

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With much effort
          Serenus lifted the cover of a small hatchway, and passed out upon
          the dark, storm-swept deck. The violent pitching, noise, and
          blackness were forbidding; and had he not been free from the
          bondage of appearances, he would have quailed at the prospect. At
          length he found Vivian, who was much surprised.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“How camest thou here?”</span> said the master. But
          before Serenus had time to answer, he continued,—</p><span class=

          place, the Salapiæ will go down, and all on board
          perish!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus was
          silent for a moment, and Vivian continued,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I must leave thee straightway, until once more I make

          return.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He left Serenus
          clinging to one of the smaller masts, and slowly made his way to
          the speaking-tube to get another report. In response to his signal,
          hollow tones full of direful prophecy came up,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Three cubita full!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pumps were
          doing their utmost, and the master fully realized that the contest
          was hopeless. But he was brave.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Heroes are not
          the exclusive product of any one time, race, or religion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He said nothing
          to the crew of the increasing peril, but with cheerful tones
          encouraged their efforts. Skilfully guiding his course to the place
          where Serenus was waiting, he said,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Hebrew! though thou art young, I am persuaded of thy

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The darkness was
          so dense that neither could behold more than the dim outlines of
          the other’s form, and the noise made conversation impossible except
          as their faces were almost together. Each put his hand upon

          other, while they steadied themselves by the mast. But both were as
          serene as if they were basking in the summer sunshine upon a
          favored shore.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Vivian, though a
          man of much worldly wisdom, but dimly understood the meaning of
          Serenus, but yet deeply felt the superiority of the man who stood

          the second, he was a spiritual entity, even though now possessing
          material form and expression. To one, when he sank beneath the

          Greek, Roman, Jew, barbarian, or Scythian! He knew the inmost
          oneness of God and man, because he knew himself as he

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In answer to
          many more questions, Serenus then gave Vivian a brief account of
          Jesus, the Christ, his mission, and the quality of his life. The
          twain, amid the hissing of the elements and the groaning of the
          pumps, stood in the thick darkness, with their arms affectionately
          around each other in brotherly communion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thou hast touched me deeply,”</span> said Vivian.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I love thy spirit, and rejoice that we
          have met! I thank thee that thou hast brought me a knowledge of the
          Ideal,—the Nazarene; so noble, so large, and so beyond race and
          outward condition! He will fill an uninterpreted longing of my
          whole life. I shall think of him even <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class=

          feel that there is something in us, of which the tempest, at its
          worst, cannot rob us. Would that I could have seen the
          Ideal!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Vivian expressed
          a tender and earnest thankfulness, and they parted long after
          midnight.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next morning
          brought no occasion for hope. The water in the hold steadily
          increased, and the gale showed little abatement. In every direction
          there was nothing but an endless gray waste of boiling waves, which
          seemed hungry and impatient to swallow up the stricken ship. The
          weary hours of the second day dragged along with interminable
          slowness, and the impenetrable gloom of outward conditions had no
          ray to lighten it. The strain and fatigue brought such a torpor of
          stolid indifference upon the crew, that to some death would have
          been almost welcome. Desperate but wholly unsuccessful attempts
          were made to draw down some remnants of sail upon the outside to
          lessen the inflow, but the water in the hold gained with fateful
          certainty.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the day
          finally wore away, the force of the tempest slowly lessened, making
          their progress less rapid. Even at the present rate, it would be
          impossible to reach Tarsus before the middle of the following day,
          and a careful survey made it a matter of great doubt whether or not
          the Salapiæ could float until the next daybreak.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The master again
          called Serenus upon deck, giving him an affectionate
          greeting.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The master of
          the Salapiæ always had been brave and manly, but now there was a
          light in his eye and a joy in his heart which was unwonted, even
          when no peril threatened. It was not so much the words which
          Serenus had spoken, but the spirit and love which filled him, and
          which he radiated, that had taken hold of the Roman.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gloom of
          another night was gathering, and the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          the blackness closed around the sinking ship, there was no more
          joyful soul on board than Vivian. Amidst all the stress and danger
          his greatest wonder was himself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Down, and still
          lower down, the helpless wreck heaved and plunged heavily during
          the second night. Would daylight ever come?</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">
            * * * * * * * * * *
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At last the
          morning dawned, and they were still afloat. The storm had ceased,
          and the sun arose clear and bright from the eastern sea. The wind
          which had driven them so strongly towards Tarsus had entirely died
          away, and a light breeze was coming from the opposite direction.
          They were able to hoist more sail, but being obliged to tack, the
          progress of the water-logged ship became hardly perceptible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tarsus was now
          not very distant, but every soul on board clearly saw that the
          Salapiæ never could reach the wished-for port. Slowly, but with
          grim certainty, the water in the hold deepened, and direful Fate,
          with cruel footsteps, was silently approaching.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The faith of
          Serenus and Amabel never wavered. Even that of Vivian was firm and
          confident. But he neglected no feasible effort that belonged to his
          calling, and made all possible preparations for what seemed to be
          immediately impending. The ship’s boats had been swept away during
          the first assault of the storm, but with all diligence two rafts
          had been hurriedly constructed of such materials as were at hand,
          and some provisions and gurglets of water and wine lashed to them.
          But the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg
          295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>waves were still high, and would wash over
          them if they were launched.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While there were
          no cries of confusion, as upon the first day of the storm,
          petitions were being offered, and vows made in various tongues to
          gods of different names.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The human mind
          at its greatest can grasp but an infinitesimal fraction of the
          Infinite, but it always has a deific ideal which fills its utmost
          capacity. No two ever possess quite the same, but to the individual
          it is the highest, and all there is. To it he must cry, and upon it
          he must stay himself, for he cannot go beyond.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the Infinite
          dwells in every man’s ideal, however low. It is the link, unseen
          and perchance crude, which draws and binds him to the Eternal
          Goodness. Let us respect the supreme pattern of every human
          brother, though he be ignorant, simple, theologically untaught, or
          even vile. For <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">him</span></span> it must stand until a
          greater and purer takes its place. The <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Father’s House,”</span> even though provisional and
          unshapely, is hidden within the deep mists of every human soul.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But look! The
          city of Tarsus, with its white roofs and gilded towers, is now
          dimly visible in the far distance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day was
          perfect. As if in repentance of her past angry mood, Nature arrayed
          herself in her most beautiful robes. The air was of crystalline
          clearness, and not a cloud specked the blue azure above. During the
          morning hours the sea gradually calmed down, and the reflected
          sunlight gleamed and danced upon the crest <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>of every billow with sparkling brilliancy.
          From the Salapiæ the vast expanse seemed to be the embodiment of
          Treachery outwardly dressed in living Beauty. With cruel spirit,
          but seductive charm, it was stealthily waiting to take mortals into
          its cold embrace forever.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ship could
          not possibly last until midday. The adverse breeze freshened, and
          her labored progress almost ceased.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But look again!
          A speck appears upon the water near Tarsus, and it slowly, oh, how
          slowly, grows larger. It was described as some kind of a ship under
          full sail, and under the favoring breeze it was soon evident that
          her approach was rapid. She was a fast sailer, and the style of her
          rigging was that of a pleasure <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bireme</span></span> rather than a
          merchantman. The freshening breeze rendered her oars unnecessary.
          Every one except those at the pumps strained his eyes in that
          direction.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hope kindled in

          cut the waves as she moved like a graceful bird in rapid flight;
          and yet how slowly the distance seemed to diminish! But new hope
          was new life! The men at the pumps received an endowment of
          herculean strength. Signals of distress were hoisted and responded
          to, and the beautiful ship steered directly for them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Salapiæ was

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rail and
          trimmings about her deck were brilliant with burnished metal, and
          her prow was surmounted with the graceful bronze statue of a
          Tarsian goddess. Upon her peak floated a silvery purple banner,
          heavily wrought with golden figures, representing various emblems
          and symbols in the Temple of Apollo. All her splendid appointments
          indicated that she must be owned by some one of patrician rank and
          great wealth. She came near. The name of the pleasure ship was
          discerned as the Nereid.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We will save you!”</span> cried the master in a loud
          voice. <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold our boats! They will take
          off every one!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before Vivian
          had time to express his gratitude, the small boats were already
          lowered, and in a short time every one on the Salapiæ was safely
          transferred to the gayly decked <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">bireme</span></span>. All were most hospitably
          received, and their necessities kindly ministered unto.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Vivian told the
          commander of himself, and of the Salapiæ, and made known Serenus
          and Amabel as his honored friends. The master of the pleasure ship
          then indicated his desire to present them to the owner, whom he
          said was a Roman of noble family, and Vice Legate of Tarsus. They
          had chosen the fine morning for a pleasure excursion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Descending a
          short flight of stairs, Vivian, Serenus, <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>and Amabel were ushered into a cabin of goodly
          size, at the farther end of which were two men sitting at a table,
          evidently engaged in playing some kind of a friendly game. One was
          tall and straight, with long black hair, heavy eyebrows and lashes,
          and full beard, of dignified bearing, and features of the Roman
          cast. The other was rather slight and effeminate in personal
          appearance, with wavy brown hair, dark blue eyes, luxurious in
          costume, and an air of polish and refinement. The first was the
          Roman, Marcius, and the other Leander the Greek.<a id="noteref_11"
          name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> After
          a brief exchange of polite greetings and congratulations, they all
          ascended to the deck to ascertain the fate of the Salapiæ. They
          were none too soon; for in a moment, with a great surge, she was
          received into the full embrace of the hungry sea, the billows
          closing over her forever.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus and Amoz
          advancing into the cave found it dry and capacious, and also well
          lighted for some distance from the entrance. A long-continued cleft
          upward in the face of the rock freely admitted the outer air and
          daylight, and also sunlight at certain hours. The walls on either
          side gave evidence of previous human habitation, being marked with
          various inscriptions, symbolic characters, and drawings. In the
          deeper recesses the darkness increased, and various intricate
          passage-ways opened into curious ramifications and apartments of
          indefinite extent. The temperature was comfortable, and the
          atmosphere pleasant.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold a favored habitation already prepared for
          us!”</span> said Amoz. <span class="tei tei-q">“The wisdom of the
          Voice is now made manifest!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yea, of a surety it hath guided us to this place, and
          here we will abide!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amoz returned
          for the camel, and soon led him to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>entrance, where he was unladen, and after a
          little delay a convenient place in the cave was selected for him.
          Before the shades of evening fell everything was well arranged for
          a stay of indefinite length.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The silence and
          seclusion seemed delightful, and even paradisaical to the restless
          and depressed soul of Saulus. The world, with its unending strifes
          and jealousies, its warring creeds and religious persecutions, and
          all the surge and sweat of human passion, was far away.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Often, above all
          things, man needs a face-to-face interview with his real self, in
          order that he may interpret the hidden springs of his own being,
          sound the intricate deeps of his primal nature, study ideals, and
          survey foundations. A life devoted entirely to the Objective, even
          if its ends be worthy, lacks an understanding of those subjective
          mental and spiritual reservoirs which is indispensable to
          harmonious development.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No one can avoid
          companionship. But objective personalities supply but a small part
          of the innate craving for intimate good cheer and friendliness.
          Whether or not consciously chosen, the ego must have a supremely
          close communion with its own thought-forms,—its veritable
          creations. As a duplicate selfhood it is firmly linked to them. If
          man must carry this secondary man with him, what sort of a
          character shall he be? His fellow-men, with whom he daily mingles,
          though seemingly near, are infinitely distant when compared with
          his own self-made mental environment,—his real world.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every man is
          like an artist who is sentenced to dwell with his own pictures, so
          hung that they continually stare him in the face. But especially
          when from choice <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg
          301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>or
          necessity one for a season turns aside from his accustomed
          Objective, he finds intimate relationship with his subjective
          structures of the past. He is forced to a careful inspection of his
          own stored-up images, and it is woeful if they frown upon him. All
          the hates, envies, and antagonisms that he has ever projected are
          turned in upon himself. They surround and threaten him, and their
          growls are disquieting. He thought they had been sent away, but
          their accumulated recoil was only postponed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
          hand, all the loves, harmonies, and hopes that have been sent out,
          now possibly forgotten, rise up out of the misty deep and send back
          a smile, and return affection with added interest. They are lived
          over again.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-lg" style=
          "margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-top: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em">
            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">
              “Music, when soft voices die,
            </div>

            <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">
              Vibrates in the memory.”
            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Heavens and
          hells are stored up in the chambers of the soul, and if perchance
          diversion for a time may seem to bury them, their resurrection and
          visitation surely follow in due course.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But as Saulus
          looked in upon himself, he found that he could increasingly choose
          and control those things that should mentally dwell with him. With
          all his cruel impetuosity of the past, his life had not been devoid
          of good thoughts and deeds, and these he struggled to keep in
          review. But vastly greater than all else, when the dark Past
          marshalled itself before him, he turned to the Present God. How
          unlike was the God he found in Horeb to the tribal Deity he had
          served in the Holy City! The difference was in his own
          vision.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg
          302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Often he would
          sit for hours with eyes closed and body relaxed, in silent
          communion with the felt Presence. At such times he realized a
          positive influx of sweetness and strength from the Universal, which
          thrilled him in mind and body.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The crust of his
          former hardness was breaking up, and his soul was growing childlike
          and plastic. The rigid dogmatism and intolerance in him, which for
          so long had been impenetrable to the Spirit of Truth, were
          dissolving, and love and wisdom were opened up, as water from a
          fountain whose seal had been newly unloosed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus marvelled
          as much at the seeming change in his God as in the transformation
          in himself. That Deity who had rejoiced in persecution, and been
          angry and jealous, was now the Author of love, peace, and concord.
          It was clear that his former concept of God had been but a
          telescopic likeness of himself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cave at
          Horeb proved to be a most agreeable place of abode, and Saulus
          found in his seclusion some of the happiest days of his life.
          Though the evening experiences of weakness and trembling seemed to
          have become a fixed habit, and scars and strains in soul and body
          were present as the legacy of the past, there was a gradual gain of
          vigor. The expanding soul was coming into a knowledge of its
          intrinsic divinity and oneness with the Father, and this reflected
          and expressed a growing wholeness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amoz, with the
          camel, made some explorations in the adjacent region; and about two
          hours distant, at a crossing of some of the more important paths,
          he found a small station of a few huts, where supplies could be
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a name=
          "Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>replenished, and
          occasional communication had with the outside world.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But what was the
          world of the past to Saulus? It seemed as if he was severed from
          everything that had gone before, and had built a new world for
          himself. His own transformation was vastly greater than the change
          from the Holy City to the cave. But he had no intention of becoming
          a hermit. He would, for a time, gather his resources, and firmly
          knit the sinews of his soul, in preparation for future conquests
          for the truth among men. The mistakes and enmities of the past he
          would bury beneath a mountain of love and good-will which should
          brighten the world.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But what of past
          personal ties and obligations? First of all, what of little Cassia?
          What of his ardent affection and faithful promises to her? Was his
          love, which formerly was so consuming, yet alive and burning
          brightly? Did she stand out in lifelike proportions in his new
          world, or had her image largely faded out of his heart? What had
          she heard of him? and what would she think?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There were hours
          when these and similar questions thrust themselves upon Saulus with
          terrible force. The intense and all-absorbing love of Cassia, her
          unbounded confidence in him, and his former rapt devotion to her in
          return, stood out before him in letters of fire.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One evening his
          period of suffering, which he had already named <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“a stake in the flesh,”</span> left him in a strange
          condition of unrest and uncertainty. The thought of Cassia filled
          him with something like its old-time intensity. Questions crowded
          themselves upon him, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg
          304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>clamored for an answer. But while the little
          maiden of the Sheepmarket still occupied a very warm place in his
          heart, with it was mingled a peculiar sense of ever-widening
          distance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He put himself
          on the witness-stand,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Am I not a different Saulus from he who aforetime
          loved Cassia, and to whom she was so devoted?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Has this new and larger love driven out my affection,
          or only for a time overshadowed it?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Is she really fair and good, or did I deceive
          myself?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Can my love ever again be so
          all-absorbing?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yes and no were
          both echoed as responses through the troubled mind of Saulus.
          Opposing emotions marshalled themselves, and in confusing
          alternation took possession of him. For a little time he forgot the
          cave and all its associations in the fierce play of the contending
          forces.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But as the hours
          of the eventful evening wore away, the thought of Cassia gained the
          ascendency. The very inscriptions of ancient lore upon the walls
          seemed to melt into her name, and yield a fragrance of her
          personality.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length a
          peculiar quietude slowly settled upon him, but he felt that it was
          not sleep. An unwonted lightness of soul and an ethereal
          consciousness subtly crept in and possessed his senses. The solid
          walls of the cave became unsteady, as if about to dissolve, but
          there was such a charming naturalness in the change that it did not
          much surprise him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Surely I am not dreaming!”</span></p><span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Of a verity, I believe that I am out of the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What lightness! what freedom!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon he found
          himself standing beside his own prostrate form. He clearly looked
          down upon the features—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">his</span></span> features! The eyes were
          lightly closed, the lips slightly parted, and the breast rose and
          fell but feebly with the movement of the breath. Otherwise the body
          was still.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What a mystery!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Have I died?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“No! that cannot be, for I—no, not I, for <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></span> am
          here—but my body yonder is manifestly animate. How easily
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">I</span></span> can move!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All feeling of
          strangeness soon wore off. Simply from force of desire he rose in
          the air for a short distance, and looked down upon his material
          counterpart as one would view a sleeping comrade. What wonderful
          liberty and power before unknown! No wings were needed to move
          through the air as he might choose.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amoz, wide
          awake, was sitting quietly near the dim lamp, but saw nothing
          unusual, believing that Saulus was asleep. Though the little lamp
          gave but a feeble light, the cave, to Saulus, seemed filled with a
          soft but brilliant illumination. Considering the unwonted powers
          and resources at his command, he was surprised at his own lack of
          surprise. His senses were extended and sublimated to a wonderful
          degree. He then tried to attract the attention of Amoz, but
          received no recognition. Not to be baffled, he took hold of him,
          and finally shouted in his ear, but with no effect.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Saulus
          began to wonder. He could see and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>hear, but not be seen or heard. He moved about
          the cave and made some further exploration, and found that the
          solid walls were no obstruction. They were not solid. He could not
          only see through them, but pass through.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the thought
          of Cassia, which had been so strongly present before, again became
          uppermost. But something of the same uncertainty within himself
          regarding her still remained.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Realizing that
          desire was all that was now needed for propulsion, he came to a
          sudden determination.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I will go up to the Holy City, and once more behold
          Cassia, and all the things that I left behind.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the speed
          of thought, he left his own body, Amoz, and the cave behind him,
          and passed out from the mountain over the desert, and on, on,
          unerringly, by the power of simple volition. Space and time were
          limitations of the past.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“cabbin’d, cribb’d, and confined”</span> is man when
          weighted down with the little load of dust which he has picked up,
          moulded, and for a brief season carried about! To him chasms of
          time and space are wide and unbridgable, and he travels his little
          round with barriers on every hand, and an ever-present sense of
          servitude.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is not
          the grosser body <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">per se</span></span> which is so much his real
          encumbrance as his false consciousness concerning it. He is steeped
          in a prevailing and ever-ruling materialism. He is enslaved because
          he is ignorant of the laws of his own independence. He not only
          lives in the thought that it—the body—is I, but also <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg 307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>bows in subjection to those ever-varying
          conditions, which with chameleon-like accuracy shadow forth, in
          exact expression, the quality of his past composite of thought. The
          consciousness which he has carelessly or ignorantly taken on, both
          racially and individually, makes it his tyrannical master.
          Sometimes, smarting under its rule, he has turned and denounced it
          as bad, and hence a gloomy and destructive asceticism. This is no
          less a mistake than a garish and overwrought materialism.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Everything is
          useful, and everything <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">good</span></span>, when not misplaced. Evil
          is therefore not made up of the real quality of things, but of
          their misplacement in the mind of man. But the very misplacement is
          educative. So rapidly as the human mentality through evolutionary
          friction is rectified, the whole cosmos falls into line. Then the
          nothingness of evil, as an entity, will be made manifest. At
          present it is the name of a condition of relativity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Psychical
          experiences, unshackled by the supposed necessary limitations of
          body in past ages, having been exceptional, have been counted as
          supernatural, abnormal, or only imaginary. The present age, with
          its scientific spirit, its broad toleration, and its recognition of
          the reign of law in every realm, increasingly finds that they are
          merely subtle links or aspects of the Universal Order. When their
          causation is traced, their normality observed, and their utility
          understood, the weirdness and seeming abnormity which have been put
          upon them will be removed from the human lens, and the true place
          and use of uncommon phenomena become evident. So <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>long as they are regarded as strange,
          uncanny, or in some degree unsound in scope or tendency, they are
          made gratuitously harmful through the quality of thought concerning
          them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With desert and
          mountain left behind in his flight, Saulus found himself at the
          portal of the Sheepgate of the Holy City, ready to enter.<a id=
          "noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class=

          <div class="tei tei-tb">
            * * * * * * * * * *
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The city lamps
          flickered here and there, the gates were still open, and the throng
          passing in and out as was wont. The shifting panorama of people of
          various races, dialects, and costumes, pouring through the massive
          arched portal with the general din and confusion, were all so
          familiar, that Saulus almost forgot himself in the midst of an
          environment so long habituated. He stood for a few moments in a
          retired corner, striving to recall the strange thread of his
          eventful past, and then joined the current which was entering the
          city. His sense of ethereal lightness continued, and he walked by
          mere easy desire without effort. Quickening his pace, he
          accidentally came in sharp contact with a Roman guard who had
          charge of the gate, and who was rapidly <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>going in the opposite direction to order it
          closed for the night. He involuntarily stopped to apologize, but
          was momentarily surprised to find himself utterly unrecognized.
          Then, halting for a moment, he surveyed his own bodily proportions,
          and they seemed as usual. But anon a sense of his newly recognized
          powers flashed upon him, and he passed on without further hindrance
          or obstacle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What security
          and immunity!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He could see and
          hear everything, but did not attract attention, and could not if he
          would. Following the well-worn thoroughfare, he soon came to the
          inn, and turned and entered. He passed by Almon, who with some
          companions were in the courtway, and continued to the family
          apartment, but seeing nothing of Cassia he ascended to the roof,
          thinking that she might be in her wonted corner. The moon was
          shining brightly, and every well-known object stood out in bold
          relief, but Cassia was not there. Then he bethought himself that
          she was presumably in her own apartment. He hurried down the
          stairway, where every step was like an old acquaintance, and coming
          to the entrance, easily passed in without any movement of the
          closed door.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-tb">
            * * * * * * * * * *
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cassia was
          seated upon a low divan, and near by, upon a small table, stood a
          lamp which had burned out for lack of oil. But, as in the cave, a
          strange soft light made everything clear to Saulus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her lithe,
          shapely form was wrapped in the ample folds of an easy <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">négligé</span></span> robe, and her long
          tresses fell <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg
          310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>behind in careless profusion over her comely
          white neck. She sat with one hand pressed against her childlike
          face, which was paler than was wont, her elbow resting upon the
          small table at her side. Her downcast eyes were swollen and red
          from weeping, her heart beating quickly, and a long-drawn sigh
          escaped from her lips as Saulus entered. He was distressed by her
          changed appearance. The happy smile which formerly played upon her
          delicate features had been replaced by a sorrowful, drawn
          expression, and the erstwhile full ripe red lips, so carelessly
          parted, were pale and compressed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“How changed! Is this really you, Cassia
          dear?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He seated
          himself by her side, and taking her hand in his, pressed it to his
          lips, and then, with a reverent air, gave her a kiss upon the
          forehead. She felt it not. Then he gazed into her eyes, hoping in
          vain that once again there might be reflected some image of
          himself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her manner was
          abstracted, and soon, with deep emotion, she began talking to
          herself,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O my Saulus! Where art thou? and what evil hath
          befallen thee? Behold thy Cassia weeps for thee and cannot be
          comforted. Shall I mourn thee as dead?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus listened
          in agony, but could not make his presence known. Every word cut him
          to the heart.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I will not believe the tidings that have come to me.
          Some say that thou hast become a lunatic, and some that thou wast
          smitten by the sun and died, and others that thou hast joined the
          hated Nazarenes. Peradventure they are all lies! O Saulus! I am
          persuaded that thou art still faithful. I wot not but that thou art
          sick or in peril! O Saulus! why dost thou not
          return?”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg
          311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then she arose
          and paced to and fro in the little apartment, and Saulus
          beseechingly followed her. She spoke once more,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O my loved one! I feel almost that thou art here!
          Something like thy sweet breath came upon my cheek! Nay! my
          imagination doth deceive me!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then she sat
          down and buried her face in her hands, and burst into fresh
          weeping.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus could
          endure the scene no longer. Thrilled and overwhelmed, he withdrew
          in like manner as he had entered. In the effort to calm himself he
          visited some of the other apartments.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After satisfying
          himself that his father, mother, and Rebecca were no longer in the
          Holy City, he again ascended to the roof and sat down, if possible
          to quiet his distress. Soon he grew more peaceful. He looked up
          into the starry firmament, far above the local and temporary scenes
          of turmoil and disappointment, and stillness came into his soul.
          The intensity of that which had been near and present was merged
          into a living sense of the broad, the Real, and the Universal. The
          personal affection which had been so narrowly centred, was
          submerged in a love that was all-embracing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With a tranquil
          feeling of strength and inclination, and without any conscious
          passage of time, he found himself again in the cave at Horeb, and
          everything as he had left it. He sought his quiet, prostrate form,
          with which he had all the while been connected by an invisible
          spiritual cord, and with a quick but indescribable pang repossessed
          his corporeal frame, opened his eyes, and sat upright.</p>

          but soon he regained his wonted composure. From long-continued
          intimacy she had seemed almost a living thing, and he had regard
          for every plank and spar which pertained to her. Now she was gone
          forever.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But mingled with
          the sense of loss there was a great joy, not only on account of the
          assured safety of every soul which had been under his care, but
          that the prophecy, for its own sake and that of Serenus, had been
          so signally verified. He hailed it as a positive sign and
          confirmation of the wisdom of his friend, and still more of the
          power of the New Faith which had been awakened within him. To his
          belief was added demonstration.</p>

          being fine, the little group, at the invitation of Marcius, were
          seated under a canopy upon the upper deck of the Nereid, while
          refreshments were being prepared for them below. The graceful
          galley, with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg

          Nereid to be manned for a day’s cruise instead. Something well nigh
          like a voice importuned me to <span class="tei tei-q">‘put out to

          years had wrought an important change both in the character and
          social position of Marcius, but the improvement in Leander was much
          more superficial.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mysterious
          meeting face to face with Alethea in the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">adytum</span></span> of the Temple proved to
          be an important event in the experience and pursuits of the Roman.
          After the weird night of that notable judgment and warning, which
          through beautiful but terribly earnest lips were wafted from the
          realm of the Unseen, he had become a man of higher ideals. Though
          fond of races, athletics, and sports in general, the overt vices of
          former years fell away, and he grew thoughtful, reserved, and even
          kindly in his disposition. Being of patrician lineage, and
          possessing excellent native ability as well as great wealth, he
          had, by the imperial edict of the Emperor Tiberius, recently been
          appointed Vice Legate of Tarsus and its outlying provinces, so that
          he was now next in rank to the Roman governor. After the reign of
          Tiberius he was continued in the same position by Gaius, and still
          afterwards by Claudius.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While he
          formally continued such outward devotion to the Roman and Tarsian
          deities as was customary in Tarsus, there had grown to be a depth
          and seriousness in his life which was unwonted for the period, and
          far removed from the grossness of his earlier years. Though having
          but a dim appreciation of true spiritual attainment, yet the
          corrupt and sensuous worship of the time became increasingly
          unsatisfying. He openly avowed to his friends that to his certain
          knowledge human life was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg
          315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>unbroken by the dark passage of the Styx, and
          that character and consciousness continued. Aside, however, from a
          light round of official duties, his time was largely given to
          wholesome amusements. But this did not prevent some irregular study
          of Greek lore, and a little familiarity with the higher ancient
          philosophy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although Leander
          was now outwardly respectable,—as the term went in Tarsus,—there
          was a growing distance between the two friends which was plain to
          both. Marcius permitted the continuance of some intimacy because of
          former friendship, and also that his influence might be helpful to
          the volatile Greek.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Vivian gave his
          unqualified assent to the question of Marcius, and added,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O my lord! my good friend Serenus hath much wisdom
          concerning the philosophy of life, present and future, and hath
          taught me to my great profit.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius cast an
          inquiring but rather incredulous look upon the young Hebrew, and
          observed,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am glad that thou art a philosopher! I have many
          questionings which disquiet me. Peradventure we may reason together
          with profit. Pardon my inquiry, art thou a Greek?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question was
          natural, as Serenus showed but little of the distinctive Hebrew
          physiognomy, and especially as philosophical inquiry and
          speculation were more common among the Greeks than any other
          nation. However, his fair and almost youthful appearance had little
          in common with the usual characteristics of a typical sage.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am a Hebrew, though a native of Alexandria,”</span>
          replied Serenus modestly.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius showed a
          little surprise; for his contact with the Hebrews of Tarsus had
          made them seem abhorrent and bigoted, and the supposition that an
          Israelite could be different was new. His sly, sarcastic look of
          unbelief expressed as plainly as words could have uttered,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“A philosophical Hebrew! A curiosity
          indeed!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But quickly
          suppressing any appearance of disrespect, and noting the noble and
          manly bearing of Serenus, he politely continued,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Pardon me! I have in no wise much knowledge of your
          people, but have had the feeling that their philosophy, and
          religion also, consisted of a foolish round of ceremonialism, and
          that their devotion is paid to one poor and exclusive tribal deity.
          And have they not an exceeding contempt for all other religions and
          peoples?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With dignified
          calmness Serenus replied,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thou judgest not unrighteously, my lord Marcius. I
          would that it were altogether different.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius was
          pleased with the serene manliness of Serenus, and turning to Vivian
          remarked,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Of all Hebrews, thy friend is the only one whom I have

          "tei tei-q">“Though born a Hebrew, I am persuaded that he

          thy philosophy?”</span></p>

          with the life of man, now and hereafter, and the cultivation of his
          spiritual forces.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By Pallas,—pardon the force of habit,—thy philosophy
          is both reasonable and well-pleasing! Behold, while it is new to
          mine ears, something within—peradventure the voice of the
          morning—seems almost to testify to its truth. But thou hast not yet
          interpreted the utterance which led me to turn from the Cydnus to
          the sea. It seemeth marvellous that, while it guided me, I felt
          that I freely chose the cruise.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“That which I have spoken may help in the understanding
          of the voice. The mind of man is so subtly wrought that it hath
          many hidden forces which commonly remain latent, and of the
          usefulness of which men are ignorant. We may be likened to children
          with playthings in their hands, in which are wrapped up signs and
          wonders. The dominion of soul or mind extendeth to the ends of the
          earth, and is in no wise limited to the bodily members. The
          Universal Spirit, though not regarded in man’s thoughts, often
          speaketh to his inner nature. Like uttereth itself to like, and
          spirit to spirit. Of a verity, it never ceaseth its whisperings to
          every inner ear that is open. But few there be that listen.
          Peradventure in some way thou art being prepared to be a listener.
          I am persuaded, therefore, that this day, before the third hour,
          thou didst have a touch, in thine inmost soul, of the peril of the
          Salapiæ, and a prompting of thy free will to come to her relief.
          That which seemeth a mystery may be childlike and plain when its
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg 323]</span><a name=
          "Pg323" id="Pg323" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>orderly working is
          made known. Thou mightest also have been moved—like as by a
          flash—by the outgoing of our own thought, which is a divine
          operation put into our own hands for ministry and service to one
          another.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Then thou dost not count the voice as
          marvellous?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Peradventure a miracle to thee, because it seemeth
          strange in thine eyes; but no more wonderful in itself than that
          the goodly Nereid is wafted along by the air of heaven.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The theologies
          of all the ages have uniformly held in disregard that which has
          been termed <span class="tei tei-q">“naturalism.”</span> But it
          seems pertinent to inquire where its boundary lines can be drawn,
          and, in fact, if it does not include everything, both material and
          spiritual. If these terms were employed simply to designate an
          orderly lower and higher in the established economy, as they
          sometimes are, their usefulness would be obvious. But they have
          been set in antithesis, one seeming to imply the divine and orderly
          course of all sequence, and the other that economy broken into or
          superseded. Can the perfect and unchangeable God contradict
          himself? Is the spiritual realm less amenable to uniform method in
          the relation of cause and effect than its external and material
          counterpart?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just in
          proportion that the normality of the summits of moral and spiritual
          attainment is presented, they are made attractive to the human mind
          and consciousness. In the very nature of things, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“supernaturalism,”</span> which savors of the unnatural
          and abnormal, fails to commend itself to the highest reason. In
          some degree it is repellent. As human ignorance, superstition, and
          irrational <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg
          324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>assumption are left behind, the hearts of men
          go out after an orderly Deity. They turn towards him as naturally
          as flowers open themselves to the sun. The book of nature contains
          a symmetrical revelation of God, and there is nothing common nor
          unclean. There is no <span class="tei tei-q">“secular,”</span> for
          all is sacred. Everything has been consecrated without the
          intervention of the puny rites of man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A lawful chain
          of sequences is as surely found in the soul as in chemistry or
          physics. When the orderly beauty of individual spiritual unfoldment
          is seen by man, be he high or low, ignorant or learned, bond or
          free, black or white, Roman or Greek, pagan or Christian, his heart
          throbs, and his desire warms towards the upward path which opens
          before him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The announcement
          came up from below that refreshments were served, and Marcius
          gracefully escorted his guests to the faultless repast. In the
          beauty of every detail, the triclinium of the house of a Roman
          senator could hardly have excelled the private dining-apartment of
          the Nereid. With artistic gracefulness flowers and perfumes were
          mingled with dainty viands. The highly polished floor, which was
          tinted with minium, exhaled a delicate, rose-like odor. Four
          serving-boys, in white robes of bissus, entered while the guests
          were standing, and placed upon each corner of the table a small
          tutelary statue, or Lar, and after all were reclining, reverently
          raised an amphora of wine above their heads, exclaiming in concert,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“May the gods favor us!”</span> Marcius
          seemed unconscious of any ostentation, nothing being unusual. His
          guests were quite at ease. Choice old Falernian and other wines
          were offered, but declined, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>and with the true instinct of a host, Marcius
          partook very sparingly of them himself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conversation
          turned upon the recent storm, the experiences of the Salapiæ,
          Tarsian life, the latest news from Rome, and other current
          topics.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the meal
          was ended they again ascended to the upper deck. With every stitch
          of canvas drawing the fresh breeze, and every spar bending
          gracefully with the pressure, the Nereid skimmed rapidly over the
          waves, and erelong the separate towers and roofs of Tarsus began to
          resolve themselves out of the broadening gray-and-white mass. The
          white sails of the ships of many nations also dotted the harbor in
          the distance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as the
          little group were again seated, Marcius expressed his desire to
          know yet more fully of the opinions and doctrines of Serenus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thy philosophy seemeth so reasonable and pleasing that
          I would fain listen to thee further. The worship of Jupiter,
          Hercules, and all the gods of Rome and Tarsus hath not given me
          full satisfaction, and their former purity hath become degenerated.
          But I would have none of the Hebrew austerity and stiff
          ceremonialism. I have beheld their gall-and-wormwood faces in
          Tarsus, and their sackcloth and ashes, self-conceit and ugly
          circumcision, disgust me. But thou art no Hebrew! If thou wert born
          to them, thou art not of them, for thou beholdest good in all
          men.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I perceive that of a verity thou dost desire the
          truth,”</span> replied Serenus. <span class="tei tei-q">“Whosoever
          seeketh it for its own sake will come more and more into its light,
          and wax strong in its strength. Nothing less can break the

          superstition and bigotry, whether of Hebrew, Greek, or Roman
          fashioning, and set men free. Only he who seeth some good—yea, some
          Godlikeness—in all hath his eyes open to behold the oneness and
          allness of Truth, which includeth concord and love, and which is
          yet to be the great religion of the children of men. The
          self-sufficient and vain-glorious devotees of the many cults and
          theologies each believe themselves alone to be righteous; for their
          outward gaze is fastened upon the most evil and unreal aspects of
          all systems besides their own.”</span></p>

          by-paths of external authority and unreasoning belief. Men have the
          utterance of the Spirit of Truth in their inmost being, but they
          fail to interpret its drawing, because they are listening to a
          confused chorus of voices outside. Behold the divine law, or the
          perfect guide, for the thought and conduct of men hath not been
          fully set forth by seers and philosophers, inscribed in creeds or
          voiced by oracles, neither hath the Israelitish Decalogue, which
          was engraven upon tables of stone, entirely contained it. But in
          man’s being, or real nature, it is written in living
          characters,—letters of fire.”</span></p>

          a commotion around them, for they had arrived at the landing where

          the hearty invitation, and with Amabel prepared to leave the Nereid
          and become guests of Marcius. Vivian also was warmly welcomed to
          the special friendship of the Vice Legate, and was assured of the
          pleasure which his visits to the palace would afford.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The state
          carriage, or chariot, of Marcius, with three gayly caparisoned
          horses of choice breed, harnessed abreast, was awaiting him when
          the Nereid landed; and soon the Vice Legate, with his friends,
          including Leander, were rolling rapidly over the well-worn flags
          towards the palace. The luxurious equipage, with the richly adorned
          charioteer and footmen, the clatter of the hoofs of the noble
          steeds, and the musical jingle of silver chain traces, drew the
          attention of every one in the streets while they passed by. As they
          dashed rapidly through the business quarter, a young woman,
          seemingly a Jewess, no longer in the early flush of youth, but of
          remarkable beauty, was just emerging from one of the bazaars, where

          To the pure eye and the right thought adverse appearances become

          this very mountain did quake and tremble because they thought God,
          like a fretful man, was angry, and therefore sent a tempest of
          thunderings and lightnings. To give our souls to the dominion of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The visage of
          Saulus as he read the missive to the end was pale but placid. Not a
          word escaped his lips, but with careful deliberation he slowly tore
          the delicate parchment into small pieces, and scattered them in one
          of the deep chasms of the cave.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Often during a
          stormy evening, when the elements seem chaotic, and the gusty night
          wind sweeps the broken clouds or dark mist rapidly along, a
          brilliant star will burst into full view for a moment, and then
          disappear.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So down through
          the kaleidoscopic procession of the ages, at intervals some great
          soul shines out in full-orbed strength and beauty. The light of
          history reveals that these are they who have passed through
          tribulation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The diamonds and
          other precious jewels owe their beauty to the intense fusing to
          which they have been subjected in the Plutonic blasts and glowing
          flames of Nature’s laboratory. The cruder natural settings in
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg 342]</span><a name=
          "Pg342" id="Pg342" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which they are
          clasped are baser, because they have never found their way into her
          crucible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the rough
          block of marble is chipped, broken, and seemingly almost destroyed
          before the imprisoned form of beauty can be set free, so the
          trip-hammers of Fate, whose terrible blows well nigh crush out the
          very life of their victim, by a strange paradox finally render him
          shapely beyond compare. The towering spirits that have worn
          material embodiment are those whose earthy cords, deemed so vital
          by the world, have, one by one, been snapped, until they found
          their life by losing it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus, the son
          of Benoni, was a casting from the furnace of such an order of
          development. Even the persecutions which had been waged by him
          doubtless had a place among the lurid flaming tongues which, in a
          white heat, contributed to the shaping of the new Saulus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cassia’s letter
          severed the last subtle cord which tethered him to the earthly. He
          was emancipated. Not, be it understood, that celibacy, asceticism,
          or other-worldliness are normal, or worthy to be sought, but that
          in the moral and spiritual economy of humanity, there <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></span>
          souls whose rounding and polishing come only through infinite
          travail.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if the white
          flower of truth and spiritual attainment seem to blossom most
          perfectly when its roots have struck deep in the slimiest moral
          soil, let it not be forgotten that the viscous mass is not the
          cause, but only the occasion, of its supernal beauty. The divine
          germ hath all potency within itself; but it becometh expedient that
          it be plunged into low conditions, until through the exercise of
          lifting itself therefrom, it not <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page343">[pg 343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>only nourishes its own strength, but finally
          transforms its base environment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the evening
          of the day upon which Cassia’s letter had been received, the two
          friends felt an unwonted nearness and soul-contact. Saulus had said
          nothing of the contents of the message, but Amoz divined the whole
          matter as fully as if he had read it word for word. Though not
          greatly skilled in the learning of the schools, there was in him a
          simple spiritual sensitiveness which made everything plain. His
          life with Saulus had brought them into close touch, and he
          measurably reflected his leader’s experiences, and there was
          oneness in heart and interest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus was not
          cast down by Cassia’s unequivocal decision, but instead there came
          a consciousness of freedom and spiritual growth. A soul-burden had
          been lifted. His great regard for Cassia would in no wise be lost,
          but the special love which had possessed him was transformed into
          simple compassion. Barred as he was from any possibility of leading
          her into the light himself, she must wait for the slower education
          of event and experience.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The evening
          being cool, the two mused before a small fire, for the service of
          which the spacious cave afforded ample opportunity. The hour grew
          late, and they long had been sitting side by side, no word being
          spoken. Perfect harmony prevailed with a stillness that seemed
          mystical.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length Amoz
          opened his lips, but his voice had a strange sound. Saulus turned
          and looked into his face. His eyes were closed, but not with sleep.
          There was a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg
          344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>calm, sweet expression upon his countenance,
          but it was unfamiliar—plainly not that of Amoz. A slight tremor
          shook his frame, but only for a moment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But harken! what
          saith the voice?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Saulus, behold thou art my beloved
          brother!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus drew
          nearer, and warmly grasped the open hand which was extended towards
          him. While filled with wonder, there was nothing to disquiet him.
          He saw at a glance that some other soul possessed the body of his
          companion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The words of thy greeting are warm, and touch my

          "tei tei-q">“I am Stephanos! aforetime of the Holy City. I come to

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There flashed
          before the mind of Saulus the Holy City! the mob in the synagogue!
          the throng, which with jeers and curses, surged up the hill to the
          Sanhedrin! the mockery of the trial in the Hall of the Squares! the
          heroic young victim! the boiling passion! the tragedy without the
          walls! the angelic face! and—his own leadership!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He bowed his

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          SHRINE</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rebecca made her
          way homeward in a state of profound bewilderment. By nature placid,
          intuitive, and rarely disturbed, her sweet soul, as a rule, moved
          with serenity amid the turmoil of life’s experiences and
          adversities.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But could it be
          that the noble Serenus was the guest of that Roman of tarnished
          memory? Could light and darkness commingle? It seemed a strange
          paradox.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having not long
          since returned from the Holy City, she was not aware of the great
          change which had taken place in the character back of that stern
          face, nor that it now belonged to the Vice Legate of Tarsus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the rescue
          of Rebecca from the stampede at the great celebration of the Feast
          of Weeks in Jerusalem, and the conversation with her benefactor,
          Serenus, to her, had stood for everything that was worthy and of
          good report. She also remembered his lofty and quiet dignity as he
          headed the notable line of captives upon whom she looked down from
          the house-top when they were led to prison by Saulus. The devotion
          of Serenus to the New Faith, and the cheerfulness with which he
          endured persecution for its sake, had left a picture upon her mind
          that could never be effaced.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her wonder
          increased when she thought not only of the apparent intimacy
          between the two, but also at the possible position of Marcius, as
          indicated by the imperial equipment. But her wonted serenity was
          soon regained. She instinctively felt the power of goodness, and
          that however it might be explained, Serenus, in the very nature of
          the case, must carry a powerful benediction wherever he went.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She also had
          noticed Amabel, and although not recognizing her as the daughter of
          Gamaliel, inferred that she was the wife of Serenus. As this
          conviction flashed upon her, there arose for a single moment a half
          unconscious shadow of disappointment, although not admitted even to
          herself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not easy
          for the human mind to regard virtue and nobility abstractly, or as
          separate from the personality through which they are expressed. But
          the calm, warm sunlight which constantly filled the soul of Rebecca
          quickly dispelled any possible mist. While she felt that the few
          words Serenus once had spoken to her, and the inspiration of his
          presence and heroism, in some way had introduced her to something
          higher than she before had known, there was nothing which could be
          interpreted as of the nature of personal love. He only had been the
          instrument in stirring the strings of her higher nature,
          peradventure to some invisible vibrations of the New Faith.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rebecca always
          had been an enigma to her people. Though scrupulously reared in the
          observance of every requirement of the most orthodox Judaism, from
          her very youth there had been within her an unfathomable
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a name=
          "Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>reserve. While
          conforming in every outward requirement to that which was expected
          of her, there was a calm but strong undercurrent of freedom, and a
          thinly concealed indifference to formalism, which had been a
          disquietude to Benoni, and an offence to Saulus. Her sojourn in the
          Holy City had perceptibly developed the essence of a new principle
          in her inner nature, which before had been little more than latent.
          Though having but the slightest contact with the personal exponents
          of the New Faith and their outward teaching, she instinctively had
          felt something of its beauty and force. But the more it had been
          repressed by the influences about her, the more it gathered
          volume.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is ever an
          unseen moral and spiritual atmosphere in which vibrations are
          constant. In it are currents and eddies, winds and calms, heat and
          cold, as truly as in the meteorological realm of nature. Sensitive
          souls, like invisible barometers, feel and register movements and
          tendencies which ordinarily are intangible. The spread of pure and
          spiritual Christianity during the time of the Primitive Church and
          immediately succeeding was an object lesson which all ages since
          might have studied with profit. It was perhaps due more to an
          unseen vital momentum—a spiritual tidal wave—than the outward
          teaching of disciples and missionaries. Unweighed by dogmatism,
          untrammelled by ecclesiasticism, and free from rigid formalism, it,
          as a vital force, went out conquering and to conquer. It was a new
          life—good news; but later to be shorn of its spontaneity,
          dispossessed of its witness of the Spirit, bereft of its healing
          potency for soul and body, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>and deprived of its innate joyousness through
          usurped authority and burdensome accretion. Its very name came to
          signify something external in the place of a living principle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The state
          chariot which conveyed the little party from the Nereid circled
          through the spacious grounds which surrounded the palace of
          Marcius, and all alighted at one of the private portals. Serenus
          and Amabel were conducted into one of the open courts, where they
          remained until suitable apartments were made ready. A small
          fountain was playing in the centre, surrounded by flowering plants
          and beautiful statues.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold we have been led in a path we knew not
          of!”</span> said Serenus; <span class="tei tei-q">“and I am
          persuaded that good will come of it.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon their
          arrival, Leander retired to his own rooms in a very unenviable
          frame of mind. For some time he had consciously been losing his
          influence with Marcius, and their ways were rapidly drifting apart.
          The official duties of the Vice Legate were performed with
          fidelity, and his growing nobility of character and public
          commendation had given Leander an illy concealed, cynical jealousy.
          But so far the fire had only smouldered. Now he felt that in the
          interest and regard of Marcius he was thoroughly supplanted. Was
          he, who for so long had been the bosom friend and adviser,
          henceforth to be left out of the account? There is a jealousy not
          born of sex which may be fed until it grows in intensity almost
          without limit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Leander finally
          resolved upon an interview with his old-time friend. He found him
          unoccupied, and proceeded to unfold his grievances.</p><span class=

          I would have private converse with thee!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius noted
          the thinly concealed suspicion and cynicism which were stirring the
          pulse of Leander, but passing them by, quietly replied,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Pray unburden thy mind!”</span></p>

          danger of becoming a victim of baseless superstition.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius was
          astonished at the bitterness of his words, but retorted with quiet
          sarcasm,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thy wonted poetic grace of expression seemeth to have

          to his years, it is meet that he should add somewhat to his
          wisdom.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Shades of Pluto! Dost thou call the babbling of fools

          hast deserted thine old associates and pleasures, and art becoming
          a dreamer. And now, to crown thy folly, thou hast brought contempt
          upon thy government and religion by making this pair of Hebrew
          fanatics thine honored guests.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius was
          unruffled by the sharp thrusts, and listened much as he would to
          the scolding of a petulant child.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          a dignified parting salutation, which Leander turned his back upon,
          and hastily left the room.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few days
          afterwards there occurred one of those religious upheavals which at
          intervals find vent in popular tumult. The number of Jews in Tarsus
          had steadily increased, and their intolerant and exclusive spirit,
          and the contempt which some of their number poured upon the Tarsian
          temple service, had aroused a bitter prejudice and growing
          hostility. This feeling, like a hidden fire, for some time had
          smouldered, only waiting for some unusual opportunity to burst into
          open flame. While the Roman authority and law, at that period,
          provided for religious toleration in Tarsus, it could take no
          cognizance of the intense bitterness, as no overt act had occurred
          to warrant interference.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a Tarsian
          holiday, and the occasion of an important festival to Apollo. For
          three days two children of the family of one of the priests of the
          Temple had been missing, and a rumor obtained circulation among the
          lower orders of the people that the Hebrews had stolen them, and
          sacrificed their bodies upon an altar for a burnt-offering. There
          was no foundation for the report, but notwithstanding its
          absurdity, it was widely accepted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tarsus was
          astir. The streets were picturesque with decoration, and lively
          with moving crowds and processions, and all through the day the
          Temple and its great garden were thronged with worshippers and
          pleasure-<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg
          355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>seekers. Every one was in festal costume, and
          innumerable small companies were waving banners, garlands, and
          palm-branches, and marching to and fro with shouts and laughter. At
          the Temple there were various ceremonies, oracular messages,
          predictions, and idolatries in progress, all forming a combination
          such as only a great Oriental metropolis of the period could
          offer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The brazen gates
          which led through marble arches into the Temple grounds were flung
          wide open, and a continuous human current, seemingly from all the
          nations of the earth, poured in. Parallel roads, some for those on
          foot and others for horsemen or chariots, led inward toward the
          intricate maze of summer-houses, bowers, ponds, lotos-groves, and
          rose-trees, which occupied the heart of the great paradisiacal
          resort. The number and variety of fountains at play were amazing,
          and the long rows of statues, arches, and booths stretched away in
          the distance in bewildering profusion. Processions of horsemen in
          rich costume and brilliant caparisonment, each carrying offerings
          for the various altars, swept in to join the great concourse. All
          ages, sexes, and conditions lent their contributions to the great
          changing panorama of color and beauty. There were uniformed
          companies, in white or variegated colors, carrying flags, garlands,
          or censers, keeping step to the music of hymns or the rhythm of
          flutes and taborets, the combination of intoxicating strains
          forming a vast confused symphony.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon a broad
          marble pavement of white and black design near the centre of the
          widespread grounds there were groups of gay dancers, the stroke of
          whose light sandalled feet kept time to the touch of small drums
          and tambou<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg
          356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class=

          and necks, and robes of diaphanous texture, the voluptuousness of
          their movements can scarcely be told. They were
          charmers,—priestesses belonging to the Temple, each having some
          part in its multiform mystical service. They were chanting a hymn
          of Eros.</p>

          <div class="tei tei-lg" style=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some of the
          trees of the groves were large,—tall branching cedars, and
          evergreen oaks with glossy luxurious foliage, casting a cool
          seductive shade upon the fresh clean grass. There were sycamores,
          laurels, mulberries, citron-trees, and terebinths, whose blossoms
          loaded the air with a spicy intoxication. The thickets were full of
          birds, so tame as to be fearless. The cooing of turtle-doves, the
          song of nightingale, and the whistle of quail, added to the
          unending composite of sweet sounds, shapes, and colors. The
          exuberance of nature, the gracefulness of art, and all that the
          genius of man could invent, combined as if to surfeit the human
          senses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Subtly
          intermingled with the degeneracy of such an age there was a blind
          but ever-living impulse toward some kind of worship. Man’s
          religious proclivities are so strong that their exercise will find
          a place, even if it be no higher than his own animal instincts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the
          standpoints of other periods, it is far from easy to unravel the
          fundamental strands of life in any given time, and justly interpret
          its underlying spirit. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg
          357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>The autocratic rule of the sensuous
          consciousness is yet everywhere supreme, but its outward
          manifestations constantly take new shape. By the unreliable
          measurements of men, the ethics of one age is made the standard of
          judgment for those of others. The radical defect—all-prevailing
          materialism—everywhere remains, but each age shifts its moral
          emphasis so that its own methods for the adoration of the lower
          selfhood seem good in its own eyes. Though the period in review was
          eminent for its moral corruption, the worship of the bodily
          creature, in some form, after nineteen hundred years of added
          experience and supposed wisdom still remains dominant. Veils of
          outward legality are everywhere drawn, and external conformity to
          undoubted standards more general—but what of the great underlying
          sea of human consciousness? The true barometric test of the moral
          and spiritual essence of any and all ages is the quality of
          thought-occupation, whether the same be boldly expressed or subtly
          hidden. The world is full of veneers, and each eye complacently
          looks upon those of its own time, while it ruthlessly strips off
          all others. The twenty-first century will doubtless be as much
          shocked by the selfishness, pride, greed, and mad rush for place
          and power, which pertain to the nineteenth, as is the latter at the
          more open corruption of the age under review.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Leander’s break
          with Marcius thoroughly embittered his morbid jealousy, and snapped
          the only cord of outward restraint which in any degree had held
          him. As a friend and guest of the Vice Legate, possessed of a
          dashing and poetic spirit, he was well known in the gay
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a name=
          "Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>society of the
          Cilician metropolis. Vain of person, and proud of his dramatic
          accomplishments, he brought them into exercise on every possible
          occasion. His delicate complexion, wavy brown hair, and dark blue
          eyes, with an easy gracefulness which characterized every movement,
          gave him a pleasing personality which was his special capital. He
          spent much time at the baths, and commanded their perfect service.
          Their oils, polishing, and perfume in some measure concealed the
          flight of years under a youthful veneer of pearly whiteness. But
          the natural sparkle of his eyes was growing dull, and the open,
          warm, and artless temper of earlier life had become clouded with
          cynicism and acerbity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His richly
          decorated chariot, which was drawn by three snowy white horses
          abreast, always drew a gaping crowd as it dashed through the
          Tarsian thoroughfares. His especial pride was to be regarded as the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">arbiter elegantiarum</span></span> of the
          city. His more immediate circle of friends was often invited to his
          entertainments, which consisted chiefly of his own recitations of
          Greek poetry and tragedy. They frequently became tiresome, but as
          his fondness for applause was notorious, it was sarcastically
          bestowed <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ad nauseam</span></span>. He entered with the
          utmost abandon into every spectacular display or ceremony, his
          fondness for dramatic art thereby receiving exercise and
          stimulation. Before ordering his chariot for his visit to the
          festival he sat down to warm himself with a deep draft of spiced
          Falernian. It came strongly to mind that on many similar occasions
          he had started with Marcius at his side. Now he was to go
          alone.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During every
          hour since their last interview his anger <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>had increased. He, the life-long friend, cast
          off for an obscure Hebrew! Impatience waxed hot, until his feeling
          rapidly became absolute hatred. In some way he would have
          revenge—bitter revenge. Was there not some possible means by which
          he could despoil Marcius of his official position, and rob him of
          his reputation? But his popularity and power made it utterly
          inexpedient to declare open enmity. Leander would bide his time,
          and find a plan to secretly revenge himself, and never rest easy
          until the downfall of the Vice Legate was compassed. As for Serenus
          and Amabel, they were beneath contempt.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Wrath or
          jealousy that is nursed grows apace, and the enmity of Leander
          would have sanctioned the murder of Marcius, if it could be brought
          about without any finger of suspicion being pointed toward him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it was time
          to depart. His chariot was waiting; and seizing the reins of his
          noble steeds, he joined the great current which flowed towards the
          Temple and its spacious enclosure. Arriving in due time, he entered
          by the most prominent triumphal gateway, and after ostentatiously
          driving several times around the broad circular highway, left his
          chariot with an attendant, in order more freely to enjoy the sights
          and sounds, and indulge in the pleasures of the vast enclosure. He
          found two or three friends, and with them joined in some of the
          sports and games. But after a time, wearying of these, they came
          upon a large booth richly ornamented with occult art, having an
          inscription over the entrance:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style=
          "text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q"

          id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a name="Pg360" id="Pg360" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Entering, they
          found themselves in the spacious atrium, where each visitor waited
          his turn, and made his choice as to which of the divers inner
          mysteries he would consult. Out of this large reception-room many
          portals opened which penetrated to unknown interiors of enchantment
          and sorcery. The peculiar class to which each belonged was
          indicated by occult emblems or cabalistic signs inscribed upon the
          various oval valves that opened farther inward. An attending
          magician interpreted them. One led to a wizard’s cave of spells and
          incantations; another to realms where converse with shades was
          held; another to oracular answers and predictions; another to
          charms for healing; another to the furnishing of love philters; and
          finally, one was given to curses and horrors.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Leander chose
          the last named. His hatred towards Marcius flashed up as he saw the
          symbols, and he would know the mystery, and perchance an instrument
          for enmity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I fear neither gods nor men!”</span> he exclaimed;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“and I will acquaint myself with the
          worst.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His friends
          sought enchantments of the milder forms.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was in an
          impatient mood, but had not long to wait when the curious valve
          leading to the department last named swung open of its own accord,
          and a hoarse voice from within, though seemingly very distant,
          cried,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style=
          "text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q"

          "text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 75%">ENTER THOU THE
          MYSTIC SHRINE!</span></span>”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He passed in,
          and the valve closed behind him. He found himself in a dimly
          lighted, narrow passage-way, which he followed, that led under
          ground in mazy, sinuous fashion, seemingly without end. He smiled
          at the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg
          361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>slight weird feeling which stole upon him, but
          pushed on. He feared nothing, for he believed nothing. There were
          no such things as visions, spectres, or shades. He had come for
          amusement—or rather, if possible, to find a way of revenge.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length the
          passage widened into a cave of indefinite dimensions. It was but
          dimly lighted by a small fire in a recess of jagged rocks. The
          walls of the cave in other directions seemed to be composed of an
          indefinable mist of unknown depth, upon which flashed a dim
          tremulous phosphorescence. Over the fire was suspended a caldron,
          the contents of which seethed and bubbled, emitting a pungent vapor
          that wreathed itself overhead in illy defined forms that seemed to
          crawl and leap. Upon a shelf suspended in mid-air without visible
          support, an assortment of tiny phials containing various colored
          liquids gleamed with an unearthly light, and near by hung small
          bundles of dried herbs and roots. Upon a rough iron tripod stood a
          grotesque statue of the Hecate, through whose eyes shone a dull red
          light, as if they were heated by an inner flame. Several skeletons
          and many more skulls were arranged at different angles, the eyes of
          which remained in their places, shining with a red light of their
          own. Leander was the cynosure of them all.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He looked about
          him for a moment, taking in the various details, and then burst
          into loud laughter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By Bacchus! an artistic combination to impress
          infants! But where, oh, where, lingereth the presiding siren? The

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then he gave
          another hearty laugh at his own wit and eloquence. The
          reverberations which indefinitely repeated themselves through the
          distant passages sounded like a multitudinous mocking chorus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          provided!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He gave another
          loud call for the sorceress in charge. The sound of his voice
          seemed split into a hundred fragments—a chaos of weird echoes upon
          all keys.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Go on with your cackling! I welcome every demon that
          sails his bark upon the Cocytus!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But as a female
          form of gigantic proportions slowly emerged from the background,
          his heart gave a leap.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Covering her
          dishevelled gray locks was a tall, pointed red turban; her mouth,
          partly open, showed two irregular rows of long, dark teeth, and her
          large stony eyes were fastened upon him with a freezing stare. Her
          features were ashy gray and unearthly.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in spite of
          appearances, Leander gathered himself together, and with a chuckle
          exclaimed,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By the thirst of Bacchus! I adjudge this a strong and
          artistic stage-setting for a Greek tragedy!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, striking
          an attitude, he began, in impassioned style, to recite some lines
          from one of the dramas of Sophocles.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After listening
          a while the horrible gigantic Shape began slowly to turn away, and
          exclaimed in hoarse, hollow tones,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Enough! I surrender!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Leander neatly
          turned the exclamation into a compliment.</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My oratory conquers gods, men, or
          she-devils!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He then
          addressed the retiring Shape.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Stay, I pray thee! Thou art not comely, but
          peradventure thou canst serve me! I would have none of thy
          incantations, but thou hast in store a variety of potions. Art thou
          skilled in their preparation?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“For more than twoscore years have I distilled and
          cunningly concentrated the occult and deadly forces of
          nature,”</span> said the Shape with a ghastly grin. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am a daughter of the Etrurians, and their wonderful
          secrets and enchantments have come down to me from the dim past. I
          have philters for the loveless, promises of treasure for the needy,
          and potions for revenge, for tragedy, for blight, and for destiny!
          What wilt thou?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hast thou a blight which will very slowly, but with
          grim certainty, dull the reason, destroy the wisdom, and hasten to
          decay before the wonted time all the faculties of the
          Mind?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Shape
          stretched out her long, bony fingers and took one of the small
          phials, and holding it before her stony eyes, replied,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In color and taste like water; yet he who takes it in
          any form, in three years will become a drivelling idiot! The brain!
          the brain! It slowly scorches, and nothing can put it out! It will
          mingle with water or even Falernian!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Shape gave a
          malicious leer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I believe neither in shades, spectres, nor
          enchantments, but of chemistry am persuaded! But how can I be
          assured of what thou sayest?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I will give thee a sign of my
          power!”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“As thou wilt.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Shape,
          taking an empty phial, poured into it a portion of the contents of
          several of the dark liquids, and the mixture was clear and
          colorless.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By the eyes of yonder Hecate, thou hast power! and now
          the price of thy potion?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“From thee, O dramatic ranter, a full purse of gold,
          for thou art rich.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Leander drew
          from an inner secret fold in his tunic a small purse filled with
          gold, and taking the phial, carefully deposited it in the place
          from whence he had taken the coin.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He chuckled to
          himself as he thought of his new-found secret for revenge upon
          Marcius, and was about to turn towards the entrance when the hag
          interposed,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“A mutual oath of secrecy before thou
          departest.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then she grasped
          his hand with her long, bony fingers, and placing it upon the head
          of the Hecate of the burning eyes, covered it with one of her
          own.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Repeat after me!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Leander repeated
          the oath.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“May all the gods curse me, if I reveal aught of this
          transaction!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Leander turned
          to go.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thou art the first who hath entered here and not
          quailed! Farewell!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Leander soon
          found himself again amid the crowds in the sunshine of the
          garden.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Was it a
          dream?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He thrust his
          hand under the secret fold of his tunic, and the phial was
          there.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg
          365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was now late
          in the afternoon, and the streets, leading from the Temple and its
          grounds towards the lower part of the city, were filled with groups
          of gay revellers on their return. There was an easy air of careless
          enjoyment which possessed all classes and ages. Young men and boys
          were waving banners or singing songs, and the flitting forms of
          women and girls in picturesque attire, with their ringing, playful
          laughter, were everywhere to be seen.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In one of the
          main thoroughfares where these merry throngs were passing was the
          largest Jewish synagogue in Tarsus. During the afternoon there had
          been a special religious ceremonial, and the congregation emerged
          in a mass just as some of the crowds from the festival were passing
          by. The recent growing prejudice, but more especially the rumor of
          the missing children, had stirred up a bitter hatred which needed
          but a spark to cause an outburst of open warfare.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No greater
          contrast could be imagined in appearance than that between the
          lively votaries of the Tarsian deities, and the stiff, conceited,
          and austere Hebrews. The disciples of the synagogue wore long robes
          with broad borders and girdles, and mingled here and there with
          them were priests with tall cup-shaped turbans, breastplates, and
          broad phylacteries. Their measured pace, solemn countenances, and
          proud, exclusive bearing seemed like a spoken rebuke and even an
          insult to the great current which was flowing by from the Temple of
          Apollo. Some who were nearest began to utter derisive cries against
          the Israelites.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Down with the bigots!”</span></p><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          burnt-offerings!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Drive them from Tarsus!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Woe to the circumcision!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hurl them into the Cydnus!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These were among
          the cries which fell upon the ears of the Hebrews as they poured
          out of the synagogue. The excitement grew apace, and the rabble
          began to close in around them, hurling such missiles as were at
          hand.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon the attack
          became general.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Turbans,
          breastplates, phylacteries, and all other distinctive insignia were
          stripped off, and many men, women, and children were beaten and
          wounded. The <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mêlée</span></span>, so quickly started,
          became general, and spread over a large space. The cry,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Murderers of children!”</span> was taken
          up in every direction.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a while the
          Jews rallied, and essayed to defend themselves, but being
          overwhelmingly outnumbered, began to scatter and flee as best they
          could. Some escaped through side streets and lanes, and many were
          borne down, bleeding and wounded.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rebecca was
          among the number. Though caring little for the ceremonials of her
          people, she still outwardly observed them from strength of habit
          and association, and in compliance with the earnest requests of her
          father.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the great
          tumult she became separated from all her friends, and twice was
          thrown down and trampled upon. At length, with torn garments and
          her beauti<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg
          367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>ful hair streaming behind, she darted through
          a narrow passage into an open square, still followed by a small
          rabble of the lowest class.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius had
          taken no notice of the festival, he and Serenus having gone upon a
          drive up the right bank of the Cydnus. They were returning when
          rumors of the outbreak came to their ears. Marcius hurried on in
          order to exercise his authority in its suppression.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They quickly
          turned a corner, when at a little distance a dishevelled woman was
          seen running rapidly toward them, screaming, and closely followed
          by a mob. She was faint and ready to fall; but seeing, though not
          recognizing them, besought their aid.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius drove
          rapidly forward, standing with whip in hand, and with an air of
          authority demanded order.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Back! I say, and leave her alone! Disperse, ye
          rioters!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As she came
          near, Serenus caught a full view of her beautiful face, and could
          not be mistaken.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“As I live, it is Rebecca!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius stopped
          his horses, announced his office, and the mob quickly melted away.
          Then lifting the exhausted Rebecca into the carriage with them,
          Marcius drove rapidly to his palace.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They tenderly
          bore her unconscious form within, and deposited it in the
          apartments of Serenus, in the care of Amabel.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius was
          deeply impressed by the face of Rebecca. There was an indefinable
          peculiarity about her charming features which the flight of years
          had not effaced. But when, where, or under what circumstances he
          had seen her, he was utterly at a loss to conceive.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the moment
          of her rescue from the mob, until with the help of Serenus he
          delivered her to the care of Amabel, he seemed to be under a
          peculiar abstraction. But mingled with an indefinable shock at a
          sense of some mysterious recognition, there was a surprise, even
          under the untoward circumstances, at her unwonted beauty and
          evident refinement. His peculiar feelings were an enigma to
          himself. Why should one of a race so generally disesteemed, even
          though comely, so move him?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The injuries
          which Rebecca had received at the hands of the mob proved to be
          severe. After attending to immediate requirements for her relief,
          Serenus proceeded to acquaint her parents concerning her.
          Remembering that she had made known to him while in Jerusalem that
          she was the daughter of Benoni, he hastened to find
          him.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg
          369]</span><a name="Pg369" id="Pg369" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the father
          was one of the more prominent of the Hebrew citizens of Tarsus,
          Serenus found it easy to ascertain his place of abode. Pursuing a
          thoroughfare which led to the Orontes Gate, in the northwestern
          part of the city, he soon approached the family domicile. Upon the
          outside all was peaceful and serene. The broad terraces were dotted
          with clusters of flowering plants and shrubs which filled the air
          with their fragrance. The silvery Cydnus lay spread out in the near
          foreground, and winding paths, with flights of steps, led directly
          down to the shore. The house, Hebraic in design, was simply though
          rather richly embellished by symbolic emblems peculiar to the
          Chosen People, and Serenus was impressed by the beauty and taste
          everywhere evident.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The door was
          opened in response to his knock, and upon entering he found great
          sorrow and confusion. Benoni and his wife had barely escaped from
          the mob, and had reached home but a short time before bruised and
          exhausted. But forgetting themselves, they were bitterly bewailing
          the loss of Rebecca, supposing that she had perished in the
          street.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Peace be unto this house! In the midst of your
          affliction I bring good tidings!”</span> said Serenus after his
          hasty but warm salutation. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am a Hebrew,
          lately arrived from the Holy City, and have much joy in making
          known to you that your daughter hath been saved from the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Benoni closely
          scanned the tall, graceful form and clear, handsome face of
          Serenus, and they brought a terrible scene of the past vividly to
          his memory.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg

          the line of captives on thy way to prison, when Almon, mine host,
          made known to me that thou wert he who saved Saulus from the
          thieves and brought him to the inn at midnight? May thou be doubly

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rebecca’s mother
          also poured out her thanks to Serenus, but being overcome by
          faintness, was obliged to seek retirement.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Benoni was in a
          state of great perplexity. The events of the past in the Holy City,
          and the unexpected riotous outbreak of the day, filled him with
          questioning and disquietude, which were increased by the sudden
          appearance of Serenus. Thrice the guardian angel of his family,
          could this man be <span class="tei tei-q">“the enemy of
          Saulus”</span>? Moreover, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg
          371]</span><a name="Pg371" id="Pg371" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>was it possible that he was the betrayer of
          the religion of his fathers?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While rejoicing
          over the escape of Rebecca, and feeling grateful for the past and
          present kindness of Serenus, a current of the bitterness and
          prejudice which possessed him at Jerusalem momentarily made itself
          felt. Too weak also from the terrible experience of the day to
          visit Rebecca, he was greatly troubled, and bowed his head in
          silence and tears.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a little
          delay, Serenus uttered a few warm words of encouragement, and
          started to take his leave, promising to come again on the morrow
          and bring further tidings of Rebecca, and peradventure perform any
          other service.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Benoni
          relented and aroused himself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          further converse.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus again
          seated himself by his side, gently taking one of his hands in his
          own, as if he would soothe his distresses.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again Benoni
          bowed his head in bewilderment. At length, lifting his eyes towards
          the face of Serenus, he inquired,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Canst thou forgive Saulus for his bitter persecution

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Benoni’s eyes
          filled with tears as he put his arms about the young man, embracing
          him warmly. Serenus arose to depart.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I will bring thee tidings from Rebecca on the morrow,
          and peradventure thou mayest be able to visit her.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conflict of
          the ages—that which hath torn innumerable souls before and
          since—the Spirit <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">versus</span></span> the Letter—waxed strong
          in the mind of Benoni for hours after Serenus had taken his
          departure.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing less
          than some upheaval of marvellous force can change a strong current
          of chronic dogmatic prejudice. It may be interrupted, but there is
          a mighty tendency for the stream to return to its well-worn
          channel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vague
          mystery of some dim recollection of the face of Rebecca increased
          the interest which Marcius otherwise would have felt in her welfare
          and improvement. Losing no time after their arrival, he despatched
          a messenger to call his own physician, and also sent for two
          skilful nurses who were to alternate in their attendance under the
          general supervision of Amabel. Then he proceeded without delay to
          take all possible means, in connection with the Legate and other
          Roman officials, for the suppression of the tumult.</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg 374]</span><a name="Pg374" id="Pg374"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A cohort of
          soldiers was hastily ordered into service; but as the Hebrews had
          all fled to their homes, except the small number that were killed
          or wounded, and the rabble scattered, they found little to do. So
          many of the leaders of the attack as could be identified were
          placed under arrest, and the Hebrews assured of future liberty and
          protection. A proclamation also was issued, over the imperial seal
          of Cæsar, commanding religious toleration.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the evening
          of the same day Marcius was alone in his private office reviewing
          the events which had happened. Crowning the strange impressions
          already noted was another, which was unwonted and distinct.
          Transcending the romance of the rescue of the beautiful and
          mysterious Jewess, a peculiar gladness welled up within him at the
          feeling of having succored the weak and innocent in the hour of
          trial. It was the first purely moral upheaval in the soul of
          Marcius of that unique satisfaction which grows out of a beneficent
          act well done. Not that he took any credit for having performed a
          simple manly duty, but rather felt a spontaneous and genuine
          thankfulness that the circumstances had conferred a great privilege
          upon him. As he looked back over a past so long ruled by
          selfishness and passion, he was surprised at the revelation of the
          luxury of doing good, even though it came in the line of official
          obligation. He almost felt a reverence for the simple Hebrew
          maiden, who had been the instrument of revealing the loftiest
          consciousness within him that he had ever experienced. A hitherto
          unknown beneficent impulse had been awakened within him that would
          never again go <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg
          375]</span><a name="Pg375" id="Pg375" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>back to latency. It included ministry to the
          weak, protection to the innocent, and help to the helpless,
          whenever opportunity might offer. Though to the world, or even the
          average man of affairs, the incident would seem trivial, yet a
          door, before unknown, had been opened, and Marcius, the Roman, had
          added a cubit to his spiritual stature.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After Rebecca
          was borne into the palace, she remained a full hour in a state of
          unconsciousness. Willing hands and loving hearts exercised
          themselves in every form of helpful devotion. No bones were broken,
          but the terrible shock, with the severe bruises received while
          under the feet of the mob, made her condition of serious
          import.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon opening her
          eyes, she was bewildered on account of the strange surroundings.
          But the bright cheerful face of Amabel, who was holding her hand
          and stroking her forehead, reassured her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was then
          made acquainted with the escape of her father and mother; but soon
          a confused mingling of past scenes, with faintness from the
          terrible shock of the afternoon, overcame her, and she sank into a
          deep slumber.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After two or
          three hours she awoke visibly improved. Though very weak, she now
          clearly recalled all the events of the day, excepting those during
          the period of her unconsciousness. As she looked up, both Serenus
          and Amabel were seated by her side. The face of the former at once
          brought before her the well-remembered scenes of the Holy City. The
          panic of the Feast of Weeks, their subsequent conversation, the
          procession of prisoners, and other events of the persecution, were
          all vividly recalled. Yet this was <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          friend of Saulus.”</span> Then she thought of the previous day,
          when Serenus and Amabel coming from the Nereid were driven through
          the streets in the company of that Roman whose dark face was so
          deeply engraven upon her memory.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There is much that seemeth mysterious to me!”</span>
          she exclaimed; and then turning towards Serenus said,—</p>

          "tei tei-q">“Of a verity thou wert the preserver both of Saulus and

          understand”</span>—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Of a truth it was not I, but Marcius, the Vice Legate,

          are due for thine escape.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rebecca again
          closed her eyes for a few moments, but her memory was busy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marvel of
          Marvels!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Noticing her
          confusion, Serenus quietly observed,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          sun!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Silence then
          prevailed, and she sank into a sweet, restful slumber.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Light of my Life!”</span> said Amabel in a low tone,

          this trial, peradventure it will be the means of bringing great
          light and peace into the soul of Rebecca.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Profound
          stillness then prevailed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the third day
          after the rescue of Rebecca she had recovered her wonted health and
          strength. Benoni, visiting her on the previous afternoon, fondly
          hoped that she might return with him, but upon the cordial
          invitation of her benefactors, consented that she should remain a
          little longer. Her interest in the New Faith grew apace, and her
          love and respect for its two young exponents were unbounded. The
          rapidity of her restoration appeared miraculous to all who
          understood not the signs which outwardly witnessed the new
          spiritual Power. The nurses which Marcius provided were not needed,
          and the physician made but the visit of the first day.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the day
          when he snatched her from the jaws of death, Marcius had not seen
          Rebecca, but manifested <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg
          382]</span><a name="Pg382" id="Pg382" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>his interest by frequent inquiries concerning
          her welfare. Some part of each day he sought the company of
          Serenus, and his interest in their conversation, and regard for
          what he called the new Spiritual Philosophy, steadily increased. On
          the third evening, learning of Rebecca’s virtual recovery, he
          expressed the earnest wish that she, with Serenus and Amabel,
          should sup with him upon the evening following. It would be a quiet
          but fitting celebration of her notable recovery.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon being
          informed by Serenus of the proffered honor, she would have pleaded
          some excuse, but feeling a great obligation to her kind host, and
          also that it would please her guardian angels of the New Faith, she
          accepted the invitation. Through the kindness of Serenus she was
          supplied from her home with everything that was fitting for her
          appearance at the festivity, so that with the delicate
          discrimination and assistance of Amabel she lacked nothing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The evening
          came, and Rebecca’s fair face, though slightly paler than usual,
          was charming to behold. With features of rare symmetry, and
          complexion of a delicate brunette, her skin was of such
          transparency that the ruddiness beneath it clearly shone through.
          Her head, classic in shape and slightly below the average size, was
          set upon a neck and shoulders well turned, and graceful in pose and
          shapeliness. Her jet black hair was lightly gathered up under a cap
          of silken gauze with a dainty embroidery of golden threads, and a
          network of delicate chains adorned with small precious stones
          encircled her neck. She wore simple but rich flowing robes, in
          harmony with her faultless form, com<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page383">[pg 383]</span><a name="Pg383" id="Pg383" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>pelling attention not to detail, but to
          general completeness and proportion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Who can estimate
          the refining and elevating influence of true and ideal beauty? No
          symmetrical soul can fail to be thrilled by its quality, and the
          admiration bestowed upon it is repaid by a reflection of its
          transforming potency. Everything, whether beautiful or otherwise,
          is ever busy in the subtle moulding of living and impressible forms
          around it into its own image. The lesson of Pygmalion and his fair
          creation symbolizes the poetic and artistic truth of a vital and
          universal principle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the outward
          form and costume of Rebecca were the unimportant elements of her
          charming presence. The purity and artlessness of soul shining
          through the visible personality formed the real attractiveness of
          the daughter of Benoni. The costume, and even the beautiful form,
          were simple accessories, like the external setting of a gem.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the hour of
          the repast drew near, the trio wended their way through a long
          corridor, paved with mosaic, then, passing two portals, entered the
          atrium or front court of the palace. Here Marcius would receive
          them. The entrances to the various rooms, with their walks,
          alcoves, and stairways, extended around on three sides, while on
          the fourth, beyond a massive wall of marble, were the palace
          gardens, containing flower-beds, shrubberies, fountains, and
          statues, with here and there a spreading plane, fig, or palm
          tree.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The court opened
          to the blue sky above, except a space covered by a large velarium,
          which was spread as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg
          384]</span><a name="Pg384" id="Pg384" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a
          shelter from the rays of the sun during the afternoon. The
          impluvium, or rain-water tank, guarded by rails of polished metal,
          received its contents through grotesque gargoyles of the same
          material, and near by a fountain poured forth a volume of spray
          into a huge round marble basin, surrounded with anemones and
          lilies. The pavement of the atrium was of white and dark red
          marbles in handsome design, and the walls decorated with carved
          panels, upon which were representations of fantastic birds,
          griffins, fauns, and centaurs. Along the sides a continuous divan
          or resting-place was supplied with soft, movable cushions, and
          stools in front.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius appeared
          soon after the announcement of their arrival. After a simple
          introduction, he gave Rebecca a cordial greeting,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I give thee welcome, and have pleasure in thy speedy
          restoration.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rebecca glanced
          timidly up into the face of the Roman, half expecting that the
          dark, stern visage of perfidious memory would be disturbing beyond
          control, so that her agitation would be evident. She had forgotten
          for the moment that the former Marcius was no more, and that this
          was another. Though the general contour of form and feature was
          recalled, the hard lines of brutality and sensuality had
          disappeared, while those of a manly and kindly dignity had taken
          their place. There was a sympathetic light in his eyes, a calm
          nobility of demeanor, and a respectful and delicate consideration
          which were delightful and unexpected. Even the voice of
          well-remembered harshness was rich, amiable, and
          friendly.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg
          385]</span><a name="Pg385" id="Pg385" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rebecca was so
          astonished at the completeness of the change that a well-defined
          flush upon her cheeks heightened the charm of her appearance. The
          severe ordeal which she had consented to undergo from force of
          circumstances, and out of consideration for Serenus and Amabel,
          suddenly lost its unpleasantness, and composure and self-command
          were immediately regained.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She responded to
          the hearty greeting, and in a manner of quiet dignity expressed a
          cordial thankfulness for his kindness in her timely rescue and
          generous hospitality.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pending the
          announcement of the serving of the supper, they seated themselves
          for a brief converse in the court. Marcius continued to address
          Rebecca.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“As a Roman citizen, and especially as Vice Legate of

          peculiar gladness that my brother Serenus and I were able to render

          praise is meet. But for his presence and teaching I should have
          been elsewhere.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amabel turned
          her eyes lovingly upon her husband, and said,—</p><span class=

          Spirit already within, cometh into manifestation in the deeds
          performed.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus gave her
          an approving smile. <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou hast spoken
          wisely. The inner or spiritual self is the veritable man, and he
          waiteth for the comprehension of the divine sonship.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I perceive that the sensuous or flesh-man is not truly
          man at all,”</span> said Marcius. <span class="tei tei-q">“How all
          the so-called philosophies of the world have erred! Doth it not
          seem marvellous that I, a Roman, have so soon become convinced of
          the truth and beauty of the New Faith? At times I feel doubtful of
          my identity, and wonder if I am myself!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thou wert not changed by the logic and reasoning of
          the intellect,”</span> said Serenus, <span class="tei tei-q">“for a
          religious belief from without is slow and uncertain in its
          operation. But when there was commended to thee the natural
          outworking of the Godlike image within, anon thou felt the New
          Faith living in thy heart, and needed not an argument, after the
          manner of men.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rebecca, turning
          towards Serenus, and recalling their conversation in the Holy City,
          observed,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Verily, I believe that from my early youth I have felt
          some quickening of the Spirit in the depths of my heart, but knew
          not what it might be. Being taught that the faith of the Chosen
          People was handed down from without, its ceremonial formality
          smothered the inner flame. But the touch of thy faith, which thou
          gavest me on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg
          387]</span><a name="Pg387" id="Pg387" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>day of the mad rush in the Temple court,
          kindled a new life of which I had but a dim perception before. And
          now, behold since I have been with Amabel, it hath waxed
          stronger!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am moved to confess,”</span> said Marcius,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“that I loathed the manner of my early life
          even before I knew Serenus and the New Faith. Once I heard a voice
          from beyond the borders of the grave which rebuked me, and showed
          plainly the life of the unseen, and that virtue hath its reward,
          and vice its natural penalty. Then I became thoughtful, and
          repented of many of my evil deeds. But yet I remained long in the
          ignorance or twilight of Truth, until the sunlight of the New
          Faith, which hath come to me through Serenus, quickly dispelled the
          darkness that surrounded me. This not so much by his words of
          teaching, as by the contagion of the Spirit that filleth
          him.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A summons came
          from the triclinium, and Marcius arose to conduct them thither.
          Being the guest of honor, Rebecca was invited to lead the way with
          the host, and they started, side by side, through a spacious
          corridor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Pardon me, if I confess that thy fair face calleth up
          some dim fancy of the past. How deceitful is the imagination, and
          how confusing!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The heart of
          Rebecca gave a great leap, but she maintained the outward semblance
          of calmness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Of all our faculties perhaps it is the most commonly
          undisciplined,”</span> she replied; <span class="tei tei-q">“but,
          perchance we may tame and cultivate it, and increase its
          usefulness.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thou speakest discreetly. Our new philosophy showeth
          that when rightly employed everything is helpful, which must
          include even the imagination.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yea, I am learning to see the good whichever way I
          turn. What a joy to live in a world where we can embellish every
          person and thing with our divine thought concerning
          them!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When unobserved,
          Marcius cast another quick, tender glance upon the face of Rebecca,
          and finally dismissed all impression of any possible past meeting.
          Nothing could be more improbable.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In its place
          came a peculiar enchantment. Such a revelation of her beauty burst
          forth in his soul that it filled him with surprise and delight. But
          though her comeliness of person was fascinating, this was
          unimportant and superficial. An adoration, and even reverence,
          filled him, which were without alloy. His high station had brought
          before him many proud and beautiful women of his own nation, who
          were refined and attractive, but this modest Hebrew maiden almost
          seemed to belong to another planet. His soul was uplifted in a
          transport of delight. Every step by her side gave him the feeling
          that he was upon consecrated ground.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These thoughts
          and experiences flashed through his mind with the force and
          rapidity of a tropical tempest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He stepped over
          a boundary line into a delectable land almost before he was aware
          of it. The paradise discovered was Love. Such a love he had never
          before known. Devotion of a depth and power of which he would have
          been utterly incapable at any previous time sprung up within him.
          What was rank, position, wealth, or even outward grace! His soul
          arose from its former state to the full adoration of neighboring
          soul-beauty. Until now he never had known the nature of real
          love.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page389">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As they passed
          through the last portal into the triclinium, Marcius was strangely
          silent and abstracted. The world had been made over, and all things
          were new since leaving the atrium a few minutes before.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The repast,
          though perfect in quality, was simple rather than ostentatious.
          Marcius, with a fine instinct, had already learned, and even felt,
          that the exponents of the New Faith, while thoroughly appreciative
          of beauty, were quiet in their tastes, and carried their moderation
          into all things.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a
          profusion of flowers, and an abundance of handsome appointments,
          but no lares or penates upon the table, neither were any libations
          poured to the gods. But when all had reclined in their places,
          there was a brief interval of silent thanks and aspiration with
          bowed heads, which was spontaneous rather than formal. The supper
          was not a feast so much as an occasion of friendly and joyful
          converse, serving as a pleasant recognition of Rebecca’s escape and
          recovery.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius, whose
          enthusiasm for the new light which so signally had come to him was
          unwearied, soon desired to resume the discussion which they had
          begun in the atrium.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Hebrews, and the many gods of other nations, have been invested
          with human passions, so that they must needs be appeased or
          propitiated. Thence cometh the universal dread and fear of an
          All-Powerful One, and the innumerable expiations, atonements,
          rites, oblations, and libations, so that peradventure some favors
          might be vouchsafed by a Deity or deities whose ruling disposition
          is that of anger. Men are not drawn by their fears, but through
          their loves. As the Omnipresent Love—the true God—cometh into
          recognition, the hearts of all will melt into oneness with him, and
          the children of men be lifted out of their fears, sorrows, sins,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The days and
          nights in the cave glided by rapidly and serenely with Saulus and
          Amoz. The stillness of the place, the beauty and grandeur of the
          mountains and valleys, the companionship of wild animals and birds,
          the luxuriance of verdure and blossom, and the sublime view of the
          distant sea which the heights afforded,—all were ministrant to
          soul-growth and inspiration. Much time was also given to a
          reinterpretation of the law and sacred writings of the prophets,
          copies of which had been brought with them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At intervals
          Saulus made short journeys to the shepherd villages in the adjacent
          country, and as occasion afforded began to teach and preach the New
          Faith to such of the scattered herdsmen as were within reach. This
          was but a light labor, and he counted his experience as an easy
          school in the practice and power of the great work of the future
          towards which he was already looking with earnest anticipation.
          Only the consciousness of a rapidly growing capacity to teach, and
          the favorable <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page400">[pg
          400]</span><a name="Pg400" id="Pg400" class=

          unwonted spiritual energy and equipment, reconciled his intense and
          untiring soul to a continuance of the sojourn in the desert.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the decision
          of Cassia, Saulus increasingly realized that a weight had been
          lifted from the freedom and usefulness of his future life, and
          although some yearnings of heart were not easily stilled, his
          mastery over them grew more complete. In the broader and more
          harmonious disposition of soul which he now commanded, he was
          astonished and humiliated as he looked back at the wonderful charm
          which the untaught and impulsive daughter of Almon formerly
          possessed for him. He had left forever behind the fantasy and
          unregulated passion which in time past raged within his soul, and
          was now able to view life in its true and broadened
          perspective.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In due time he

              became his wife and fled with him, and returned not to her
              father’s house. They journeyed to Cæsarea and took ship for
              Tarsus, on the way to Rome, toward which they had set their
              faces. The vessel was sunk in the depths of the sea, but behold
              every soul on board was saved and brought to Tarsus by the Vice
              Legate, whose ship chanced to be near at hand. And now I make
              known unto thee the most marvellous thing of all. Through the
              faithful devotion and teaching of Serenus and Amabel, both the
              Vice Legate and our father and mother have become disciples of
              the New Faith. I am persuaded that thy heart will leap for joy
              when these tidings meet thine eyes! An iniquitous outbreak of
              persecution in Tarsus, which seemed only evil, was blessed in
              the ripening of this good harvest.</span></p>

              our people were cruelly set upon as they came from the services
              of the synagogue. It arose from a lying rumor, and came so

              their hands. They brought me to the dwelling-place of Amabel,
              which is connected with the Legate’s palace. Through her

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tears of joy
          coursed down the cheeks of Saulus as he finished reading the
          letter. He folded it to his bosom, went out of the cave, and made
          his way up to a frequented seat upon the heights.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The late
          afternoon sun, not too hot, softly gilded the surrounding Sinaitic
          peaks, and kindled a golden radiance upon the vast expanse of the
          distant Red Sea in the west. Every tree, plant, blossom, and bird
          seemed to be rejoicing in the rich, warm glow which bathed heaven
          and earth with its beauty.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The objective
          world was the fitting symbol and correspondence of the joy and
          fruition which flooded and enlarged the soul of Saulus. The message
          from Rebecca softened and melted the few hard vestiges of his
          former state, and the tender greeting from Serenus caused a great
          upheaval of love and thanksgiving. The dark clouds of past memories
          were dissolved and scattered by the warm sunshine from Tarsus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To Saulus the
          light of God was within and without, and each seemed but a varying
          aspect of one continuous and many-sided Revelation. Man was the
          crown of Nature, and in him its apex towered up until it touched
          and became one with its Author. How shrunken, mean, and unlovely
          the life of the past, which was now dimmed and even overflowed by
          the privileges and possibilities of the future which were unfolded
          before him.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page404">[pg
          404]</span><a name="Pg404" id="Pg404" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A procession of
          months went by, and the time arrived when Saulus, strengthened and
          confirmed in spirit and power by his long retirement, was ready and
          eager to enter again the busy world of men. Any hardship, or even
          persecution, which he might meet would not discourage, but rather
          stimulate, his activity. Like other great souls who have recognized
          eternal principles, he knew that the progress of Truth was hastened
          by opposition. To encounter indifference would be far worse, but
          this could not be. A man whose inner nature is at a white heat must
          and will arouse antagonism. Error smarts when revealed by the rays
          of Truth. There can be no truce. Enthusiasm begets other
          enthusiasm, which may be either for or against itself, but in its
          presence stagnation is impossible. One earnest soul stored with the
          dynamics of Faith will accomplish more than a thousand whose
          spiritual outgoings are feeble and uncertain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus was
          deeply moved as he finally left the secluded dwelling-place which
          had been hallowed by so many profitable experiences, and the scene
          of so much soul-growth. But the fulness of time had come, and with
          Amoz he gladly set out upon the long journey. After an uneventful
          crossing of the desert they reached Damascus in due season.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Making their way
          to the house of Ananias, they were hospitably received. Saulus lost
          no time in visiting the synagogues, and immediately began to preach
          the higher life in spiritual simplicity as it had been proclaimed
          by Jesus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Jewish
          Hellenists and proselytes were numerous in Damascus, and up to the
          time of the arrival of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg
          405]</span><a name="Pg405" id="Pg405" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>Saulus, the liberal party, including those who
          had nominally accepted the New Faith, lived in mutual toleration
          with the bigoted school of the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Halacha</span></span>, which was much more
          powerful. But now the dry bones were shaken. Soon the burning and
          unanswerable arguments of Saulus awoke a storm of angry opposition.
          The slumber in dead forms was rudely ended, and fierce persecution
          began.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ananias and the
          little band of liberal Jews found themselves utterly unable to
          quiet the storm which this dangerous intruder aroused. It was as if
          Stephanos had arisen and come back to shatter the self-sufficiency
          and deadness of ceremonialism, and now, as in his time, religious
          intolerance burst aflame.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The life of
          Saulus was demanded. The Ethnarch of the city, who commanded the
          garrison, being in sympathy with the persecution, lent his aid to
          the conspiracy to end the career of the over-zealous young heretic.
          The gates of the city were watched night and day to prevent his
          escape. Was his work to be brought to a close before it had fairly
          begun?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not another day
          must pass or it would be too late to save him. There was a hurried
          consultation of his friends. Happy thought! the house of one of
          them abutted upon the city wall! The plot may yet be frustrated! He
          is secretly conducted to this house in the evening. The night is
          dark, and the sentry passes but infrequently! A little knot of
          faithful friends with anxious hearts are on the watch! A large
          basket held by a strong rope hangs out of the window over the wall.
          All is still, and Saulus steps in. The sentry goes by, and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg 406]</span><a name=
          "Pg406" id="Pg406" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>now strong hands
          lower the basket, down, down, carefully but swiftly. It reaches the
          ground!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By previous
          understanding Amoz is not far away, and arm in arm they go out into
          the darkness. Surely an ignominious beginning!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One warm
          afternoon a few weeks later Saulus and Amoz approached the Damascus
          Gate of the Holy City. Though hot and weary from their journey, as
          they came near its end they were imbued with new life and
          courage.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In many of the
          towns and villages through which they had come Saulus discoursed in
          the synagogues, but made no lengthy sojourn, as he was anxious to
          reach Jerusalem and confer with Peter, Barnabas, and other
          disciples of the New Faith.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As they entered
          the well-remembered portal, Saulus was reminded of the brilliant
          cavalcade at the head of which he formerly passed out, as compared
          with his unheralded return on foot with but one of his many
          companions. But despite the contrast, a great flood of thankfulness
          filled his heart.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A multitude of
          strange thoughts crowded upon him as his eyes rested again upon
          familiar places and scenes. Should he show his face boldly, or for
          a while avoid his old friends and companions?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What of Cassia
          and the household of Almon, his comrades of the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Urim</span></span>, the Rabban, and the
          Sanhedrin?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here was the
          Lyceum, where he had hotly contended for the hard dogmas of the
          Jewish law; here the many places where he had scourged men, women,
          and children; and here the prison whose cruel doors, at his
          command, had closed upon Serenus, Amabel, and the rest of the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407">[pg 407]</span><a name=
          "Pg407" id="Pg407" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>congregation of the
          Upper Chamber. He felt like a stranger from some far country, and
          the past flitted before him as a dark and terrible dream from which
          he had newly awakened.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Somewhat changed
          in appearance and costume, he passed through several streets
          unrecognized, finally turning into the courtyard of a dwelling
          where he had been told in Damascus he would find Peter and
          Barnabas. Amoz, after an affectionate farewell, left him to seek
          some of his own kinsfolk who dwelt in another part of the city.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In response to a
          knock at the door of the house of Peter, it was opened by a maid,
          who when she saw his face uttered a loud cry, and shrank back
          affrighted into the house. Then Peter’s wife came quickly to see
          what had happened. She too looked upon the well-remembered
          features, exclaiming with great fear and agitation,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thou art Saulus! Hast thou returned to take us to
          prison?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay, I bring peace to this house! I am no more a
          persecutor, but of the New Faith! I pray thee, is Peter
          within?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Peter’s wife
          suspected craftiness, and did not believe him, but stood trembling,
          not knowing how to make reply.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Peter is not within!”</span> said she after some
          hesitation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I might have expected that all would flee from
          me!”</span> said Saulus, half to himself. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“A righteous retribution!”</span> Then, continuing in
          an earnest and friendly tone, he said,—</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a name="Pg408" id="Pg408" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Of a surety I am now a follower of the
          Nazarene!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Peter’s wife
          still hesitated, not knowing what to believe, and Saulus turned
          sorrowfully away, saying,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Tell Peter that I love the brethren! I will come again
          after his return.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The maid had
          escaped from the house, and quickly warned the faithful who lived
          in the neighborhood. Many fled from their homes, taking their
          children with them, believing that, as Saulus had returned, a new
          persecution was at hand. Consternation reigned, and word was sent
          out among the disciples in other parts of the city that they were
          again to be harassed and hunted down.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus was
          sorely grieved when he left the house of Peter. He was counted an
          enemy among his friends. He almost wished himself back in the
          desert.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was now
          evening, and not expedient to visit Peter’s house before the
          morrow. He walked aimlessly along the street hardly knowing what to
          do, but being weary, and seeing a small inn near by, entered,
          thinking to sojourn for the night. After removing the dust and
          sweat of the journey, and partaking of a light supper, he walked
          out to enjoy the cool of the evening, and calm his troubled
          thoughts. The moon was bright, the air soft, the streets crowded,
          and the sound of voices and laughter echoed from the
          house-tops.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What a contrast
          with the desert and cave! What a great network, and even tangle, of
          disagreeing interests, systems, opinions, and religions! How sorely
          the world needed the resolving and transforming power of the new
          life, and a knowledge of the higher law! Selfish<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page409">[pg 409]</span><a name="Pg409" id="Pg409"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ness, prejudice, sensuality, and
          devotion to the seen and temporal, everywhere dominant! What a
          change in himself, and in his interpretation of life!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As these
          reflections coursed through his mind, he found himself at the
          entrance of one of the public gardens which skirted the slope of
          Mount Moriah. The spicy odor of plant and blossom lent a charm to
          the place, and being in a meditative mood, he entered and seated
          himself in a retired corner of one of the bowers. Groups of people
          were all around, some seated and others promenading, seeking the
          enjoyment of social converse and recreation. Occasional peals of
          laughter and snatches of song gave evidence of the
          light-heartedness of the children of the Orient.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Saulus was
          wrapped in a more profound revery. With a heart full of love he had
          come to bear a great blessing to the Holy City, but none would
          receive it. To his old friends he was now a renegade and traitor,
          while to his new brethren he was a terror and a cause of offence. O
          ungrateful world! With head bowed between his hands, the hot tears
          could not be held back.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A young man and
          woman from among the promenaders sat down near him. Although they
          were hard by, a partial partition of vines intervened, effectually
          secluding him. He started to arise, but could not retreat without
          passing directly before them in the full moonlight to the entrance
          of the bower. Moreover, the conversation could not concern him, so
          he kept his seat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <span style="font-size: 144%">SCOURGING AND FLIGHT</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the following
          morning Saulus was up betimes, after a restless night, which was
          marked by dreams and visions of varying import.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would be
          unreasonable to expect that as yet he was able to put under foot
          all adversities, and continually dwell upon the heights of a
          spiritual consciousness. Even in a great and lofty soul, Adam dies
          hard, and in an intense nature he fights desperately for his life,
          and has many apparent resurrections. Spiritual evolution has its
          ebb and flow, and except from a broad point of view its declensions
          often appear to be enduring. As with material structures, if the
          work projected is to reach beyond the hidden foundation, it must
          needs wait until the latter is broadened.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Saulus had
          a good measure of the same spirit which filled the great Prophet of
          Nazareth, he also had an earnest desire during his stay in the Holy
          City to learn more of the particulars of the Master’s outward
          life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the rising of
          the sun he set out for Golgotha. He fain would stand upon the spot
          of the great Martyrdom. Even the hallowed ground, with its
          associations, would be a means of inspiration to one like Saulus.
          As he reached the skull-shaped hill, the sun was shining
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg 413]</span><a name=
          "Pg413" id="Pg413" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>brightly, the air
          clear and soft, and the whole scene quiet and peaceful. He felt a
          benediction!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How much the
          great Tragedy that was here consummated signifies to the world! How
          the outgoing circles of spiritual life and love ever pulsate from
          this centre! No nation is too remote to be washed and beat upon by
          its outgoing waves, for a divine discontent never permits of
          stagnation!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Golgotha, or the
          hill of Calvary, was a peculiarly sacred place to the disciples,
          and they often resorted to its summit for converse and
          meditation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Saulus
          lingered, busy with the thoughts of the past and questions of the
          future, a man, apparently having the same purpose, came near. Lo,
          it was Barnabas!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They beheld each
          other, face to face, and surprise was pictured upon the features of
          both.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">thou</span></span> here, Saulus!”</span> said
          Barnabas, involuntarily drawing back with trepidation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Barnabas, hear me! I love thee and all the
          brethren!”</span> Stepping forward, he embraced his old friend,
          saluting him warmly.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Saulus</span></span> numbered among the
          disciples!”</span> said Barnabas, putting his hands upon his
          shoulders and earnestly looking into his face, still hardly able to
          believe the truth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“As I live,”</span> said Saulus, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“my heart hath been warmed by the New Faith! Oh,
          receive my testimony!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I doubt no more, and rejoice in thy behalf. Accept a
          brother’s welcome!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Falling on each
          other’s necks, they had great joy in a fellowship of faith and
          love.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page414">[pg
          414]</span><a name="Pg414" id="Pg414" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a season
          of delightful converse, they started, arm in arm, for the city.
          Barnabas gladly went with Saulus to the house of Peter, and set him
          and the other disciples aright concerning their former
          persecutor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thou sayest,”</span> said Saulus, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“that the churches have peace, and are edified, and
          walk in the comfort of the Spirit! Hath the Sanhedrin ceased all
          persecution against them?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Of late it seemeth to have given little heed to us, so
          we have in no wise been disquieted. They have not hindered us from
          teaching that Jesus was indeed a great Prophet.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“How is it that their bitterness hath been put
          away?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Peradventure that Gamaliel and other of the liberal
          Jews counselled that we be let alone until our doctrine came to
          naught, and also because the disciples in great measure have
          returned to a conformity to the wonted ordinances and
          ceremonies.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A shadow passed
          over the face of Saulus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Dost thou not count such a conformity as a fellowship
          with dead works? I am minded that the gospel should be separate,
          and that the household of the New Faith should be counted no longer
          as a Jewish sect!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It hath seemed expedient to some that for the present
          the ordinances be continued for the sake of peace, but verily I am
          persuaded that our spiritual life hath been deadened thereby, and
          its power diminished. Now that thou art here to cast in thy lot
          with us, our zeal may be warmed, and we receive a
          quickening.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seems
          probable that the Sanhedrin had come to regard the church of Peter,
          James, and John as but one <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page415">[pg 415]</span><a name="Pg415" id="Pg415" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>more sect added to the complex Jewish economy,
          which was willing to continue the established ritual. But in the
          movement of Jesus, and afterward of Stephanos and Saulus, it
          discerned a disturbing and vital force which in due time would
          logically supplant Judaism through the establishment of a religion
          radically different.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not
          difficult for Barnabas to reconcile the disciples to Saulus, for
          not only was his sincerity manifest, but his earnest aggressiveness
          in their behalf was bold and untiring.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The law of
          specific gravity among souls is no less invariable and operative
          than with fluids and solids. If a born commander be placed in the
          ranks of the private, he will not remain, for all the laws of the
          universe conspire to lift him into his fitting niche. The moral and
          spiritual dynamics of a great soul can no more stay pent up than
          the forces that stir a volcano into activity. The advent of Saulus
          into the Holy City ended all indifference and stagnation, and soon
          the various elements were glowing at a white heat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But a few days
          elapsed after his arrival before he began teaching and preaching in
          the synagogues. Among all the enemies who sprung up to oppose his
          work and persecute him, none were more bitter and unrelenting than
          his former comrades of the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Urim</span></span>. These were the same who
          once had glorified him beyond measure.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dignified
          Sanhedrin for the time was disposed to close its official ears to
          the work of their former agent and instrument, doubtless having in
          mind their moral discomfiture at the trial of Stephanos. They
          thought it more politic to leave the rabble to deal with him
          through <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg
          416]</span><a name="Pg416" id="Pg416" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>some sudden outbreak than to take formal
          cognizance of his heresies through the procedure of a regular
          trial.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus boldly
          entered into the synagogues of the Hellenists, and eloquently
          commended the New Faith, contrasting its power and beauty with the
          traditions, ordinances, and dead works of the Temple service.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One afternoon at
          a meeting in the synagogue of the Cyrenians, Saulus essayed to make
          an address according to previous announcement. It was in the same
          room where Stephanos had spoken with such zeal, and from which he
          had been dragged to trial and condemned.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon this
          occasion the enemies of Saulus gathered in strength, the members of
          the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Urim</span></span>, by secret understanding
          occupying the front seats, thoroughly organized for offensive
          action. He had been warned of trouble by the more prudent of his
          friends, but would not consent to abate one jot of his stirring
          presentation of the new gospel, and the contrasting hollowness of
          the whole ceremonial system.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a full hour
          before the opening of the service the synagogue was crowded, and a
          dense throng gathered outside. At length the exercises began.
          Saulus arose to speak, but had hardly uttered a sentence before
          there was such a tumult that his voice could not be heard. He
          beckoned for silence, but the uproar continued. At length he picked
          up a roll of the law to read from the prophets, and the gathering,
          willing to show some respect to their Scriptures, was quieted. He
          read the following passages from Isaiah:—</p>

          longer, they rushed madly forward, and dragged him from the
          reading-desk.</p>

          "tei tei-q">“The scourge! the scourge! the scourge!”</span> shouted
          angry voices from all parts of the synagogue.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Looking
          steadfastly into the malignant faces which <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page418">[pg 418]</span><a name="Pg418" id="Pg418" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>surrounded him, a mingled expression of
          dignity, compassion, and contempt was upon his countenance. The
          spiritual exaltation of his soul so overshadowed his bodily
          consciousness that he felt no fear, and neither he nor his friends
          offered any resistance to the howling mob which threatened him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was one of
          those upheavals with which history is crowded, which have taken
          place among nearly all races and religions. There is no crime nor
          indignity that has not again and again been committed by religious
          bigotry gilded by assumed dutiful consecration.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Their decision
          was spontaneous, and Saulus was taken away without legal formality
          or deliberation. Through the irony of fate, he was led outside the
          gates to the same spot where Stephanos had been stoned under his
          own supervision.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tying both of
          his hands to a column, they proceeded as was usual in cases of
          punishment by the scourge. The leaders tore down his robe until his
          breast and shoulders were laid bare, then the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Chazzan</span></span> of the synagogue, as was
          customary, was selected to administer the flagellation. The scourge
          was composed of two thongs of ass’s hide which passed through a
          hole in the handle. Standing on a block of stone behind the
          prisoner, the executioner wielded the blows with all the force of
          one hand, thirteen times on the breast, and thirteen back of each
          shoulder—in all, forty, save one.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although there
          had been no formal trial and condemnation, the usual custom in
          cases of scourging was followed. Three judges were chosen,—one
          reading the prescribed passages from the law while the punishment
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page419">[pg 419]</span><a name=
          "Pg419" id="Pg419" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was being inflicted,
          the second numbering the blows, the third giving the order before
          each blow, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Hakkehu</span></span>”</span> (strike him).
          Even in the methods of a mob the slavish literalism and ingrained
          devotion to traditional detail were not lacking.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though the
          scourging was given in full measure, Saulus was not greatly
          overcome. Before the first blow fell he passed into such a
          spiritual ecstasy that little consciousness of the body or of
          painful sensation was manifest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among a little
          group of women who gathered to witness the punishment was Cassia,
          who as the blows fell had alternations of hysterical weeping and
          laughter. She insisted upon being present, and could not be
          dissuaded. The most opposite emotions possessed her. After the
          scourging, but before Saulus was led away, a look of recognition
          passed between them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was
          silent!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The stripes were well laid on, and thou hast thy just
          reward!”</span> she cried with a loud, scornful voice; then,
          bursting, into tears and groans, she was led away by her friends.
          Hatred and love, burning in their severity, struggled within her
          for mastery, but the former was victorious.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus rapidly
          recovered from his punishment, and utterly undaunted by his
          experience, again began preaching and teaching. But the brethren
          became apprehensive for his life, and also feared that another
          general persecution might begin. Though holding his power and zeal
          in great respect, they advised his immediate retirement from the
          Holy City. But he was reluctant to follow their counsel. Soon a
          well-matured plot among <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page420">[pg
          420]</span><a name="Pg420" id="Pg420" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>the members of the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Urim</span></span> came to the knowledge of
          the brethren, and they yet more strongly urged his flight. But as
          it seemed like an abandonment of his long-cherished plans, and a
          dishonor to the cause which was so all important, he still
          lingered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the day
          before a whispered conspiracy was to have been consummated, Saulus
          retired to a quiet place for spiritual communion and guidance. He
          had trusted the inner Voice before, and been led aright, why not in
          the present strait? The intensity of his desire and emotion ended
          in a vision.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href=
          "#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> He
          entered into a state where a broadened outlook of condition, duty,
          and privilege was opened before him. The dark curtain which made
          the future obscure and perplexing was parted, and a highway,
          leading forward, illumined and made plain.</p><span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The inner Voice
          said,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus hastily
          escaped from Jerusalem, being conducted by his brethren as far as
          Cæsarea on his way to Tarsus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A day of extreme
          heat was closing in Tarsus. The heavens were like burnished brass,
          and the sultry air glowed as if newly discharged from the mouth of
          a furnace. The sun had dropped behind a heavy mass of leaden
          clouds, tinged with crimson, which hung ominously over the distant
          range of the western Taurus, though the horizon above the city was
          still clear. The torrid radiation from the dark paving-stones had
          arisen in quivering waves every hour of the long day, and
          penetrated alike palace and hut.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius was
          seated in his private library in an absorbed though somewhat
          restless temper of mind. There are times when the soul is lifted
          out of the petty routine of every-day living, and thus loosened
          from present environment, it soars abroad among scenes and
          recognitions long past, or, anon, essays to penetrate the veil of
          the future. During such seasons the human spirit transcends its
          ordinary limitations, and is uplifted by aspirations and
          experiences which are beyond the realm of cold logic and
          materialistic science.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page423">[pg
          423]</span><a name="Pg423" id="Pg423" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of late one
          portentous augury of bygone days lingered in the mind of Marcius
          with untiring persistency. It was but a brief deliverance, yet it
          stood before him in letters of fire. He had often thought it
          trivial, and dismissed it from recollection, but as often it
          returned, refusing to be barred out. Was it a prophetic curse? or
          only a simple warning which already had been heeded and its
          occasion atoned for?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This evening the
          problem came upon him afresh, and the fateful words fairly rung in
          his ears,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thou art incapable of love, and it shall remain
          unknown to thee!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How vividly that
          strange scene of the past flashed before him! The mysterious
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">adytum</span></span> of the Temple; the
          clammy, crawling vapor; the uncanny Shapes; the ghostly but
          beautiful Alethea, and her divination of the future!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He thought
          lightly of its interpretation when uttered—now it weighed him
          down.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His love for
          Rebecca had become a consuming flame, but it was a white flame,
          unmingled with smoke. Day by day every passing breeze fanned it. In
          her the transparent beauty of the New Faith blossomed into visible
          illustration and embodiment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius had not
          yet made an avowal of his love, for he consciously shrank from
          breaking in upon the secrecy of the inner adoration of his own
          soul. If she felt no response, a declaration would only rudely
          disturb the symmetry of his beautiful dream, and if perchance there
          was a reciprocal glow, the delightful mystery, like a sealed
          fragrance, would keep. In social relation with <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page424">[pg 424]</span><a name="Pg424" id="Pg424"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>him she was natural and friendly, but
          anything beyond was an enigma.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But again the
          direful words of Alethea, like the muttering of the now distant
          thunder, reverberated through his soul, and disturbed his dream of
          bliss. Was he forever doomed to be a stranger to a rounded and
          reciprocated love? Might not Alethea now relent, and dissolve her
          seeming curse, and grant a blessing instead? Can it be that human
          jealousy invades the realm of the Unseen?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Could he not,
          peradventure, again invoke the fair Alethea, and while beseeching
          her own forgiveness for the past, implore her blessing for the
          future?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The threatened
          storm gathered and burst with great force upon the city. Rain, and
          at intervals hail, beat upon the walls and roofs of houses, and
          cooled the hot flagstones in the streets. Forked lightning rent the
          clouds, and thunder caused the very foundations of the city to
          tremble.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since Marcius
          espoused the New Faith he had discontinued visits to the Temple of
          Apollo. But now he strongly desired to meet Alethea. Would she
          again appear to him if he sought her in the same place? Her
          condemnation <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">must</span></span> be lifted, her forgiveness
          obtained, and her benediction implored!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The roar of the
          storm continued with little abatement. What a favorable time to go
          unattended and incognito! The desire strengthened into immediate
          purpose. Disregarding the tempest, he ordered a trusted servitor to
          bring his favorite horse, and hastily disguising himself, mounted,
          and rode rapidly toward the Temple.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page425">[pg 425]</span><a name="Pg425" id="Pg425" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon entering he
          found the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><a name="corr425" id=

          "tei tei-corr"><span style=

          a few scattered devotees in the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">cella</span></span>. Throwing off his outside
          garment, he seated himself for a little time to command his
          thoughts before penetrating into the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">adytum</span></span>. The perpetual sacred
          fire on the great hearth sent its fitful gleams upon the symbols
          and hieroglyphs which thickly covered the walls and ceilings. As he
          sat and watched them they seemed to fade, dissolve, and reappear in
          capricious succession, inspiring a sense of the presence of
          invisible enchantments. The harps of Æolia, which hung in the
          openings of the outer walls, groaned and shrieked a chaotic
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Miserere</span></span>, as if a great chorus
          of condemned spirits were disquieted by the force of the angry
          tempest without.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length the
          signal was given, and Marcius passed through the valve, and
          following for some distance a dim, winding, and descending
          corridor, at length entered the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">adytum</span></span>. As aforetime, the
          flaming symbol of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Mysteria Eleusinia</span></span> flashed upon
          him, and then slowly faded into a ghastly vaporous obscurity.
          Farther on faint flashes of blue light shot up from deeps which
          seemed bottomless.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius silently
          waited for a brief period, hoping that Alethea would again appear,
          but was disappointed. There was no sound save distant echoes of
          discordant voices, now seeming to be above, and anon issuing from
          the pit below.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Presently,
          wearied of waiting, he called aloud,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Alethea! I would see Alethea!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mocking
          sepulchral reverberations of his words were the only
          response.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page426">[pg
          426]</span><a name="Pg426" id="Pg426" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again pouring
          out his request with a like result, his wonted composure was
          considerably shaken.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With growing
          disappointment he was about to make one louder call before leaving,
          when at his right hand an unseen valve suddenly opened, revealing a
          narrow private stairway hitherto unknown to him, leading from some
          of the many apartments of the great Temple above. A moment more,
          and footsteps, light but very real, were heard coming down.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A female form of
          enchanting beauty gracefully entered, and stood before him. Her
          eyes of a deep liquid blue turned towards him, her silken, blond
          tresses fell artlessly backward, and her features were of such
          loveliness as rarely comes in human mould. A white, flowing robe of
          exquisite softness and gauzelike lightness enveloped her form,
          leaving her shapely neck and shoulders fully exposed. A delicate
          fragrance of wild rose was borne in upon the atmosphere with her.
          There she stood, slender, lithe, symmetrical, radiant.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius was
          startled.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was neither
          Alethea, nor any other spirit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Who art thou? and why didst thou appear when I called
          for another?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“This is the night for mortals, and not for
          spirits!”</span> she replied sweetly. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am
          one of the priestesses of the Temple, and they call me the
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Chosen One.’</span> ”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What is thy mission here?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold thou didst vainly call for some one, and I have
          come to charm away thy disappointment, give thee solace, and keep
          thee company.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She
          smiled.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page427">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius
          retreated for a step, but his gaze was fastened upon her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Peradventure thou dost count me for a shade who hath
          momentarily put on the form!”</span> she said archly. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But no! I am very real flesh and blood!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then she lightly
          touched her hand to one of his own convincingly.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am well persuaded that thou hast never crossed the
          Styx; but I came hither especially to see another, who dwelleth
          beyond.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The signs to-night forbid!”</span> she replied with an
          intelligence that seemed to be official. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Four nights of each week the mystical curtain which
          veils the Unseen is parted, but this is not one of
          them.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I will come again,”</span> Marcius replied in a low
          voice, beginning to turn away.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hasten not! Perchance thy discomfiture and loneliness
          may be soothed. Doth not the dominion of Eros cover the earth as

          mastery? Even the stars of heaven woo each other by their
          attractiveness, and flash forth their kisses in beams of light, and
          the cohesion of atoms is but the warm embrace of an universal
          enchantment!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I cannot listen to thee!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          honor!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I close my ears to thy beguilement!”</span></p>

          "Pg428" id="Pg428" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and withal cold in
          thy devotion to our sacred divinities!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thy words are wasted, and touch me not!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She came nearer,
          placing her hand upon her heart, and looking into his eyes,
          said,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold the roar of the storm without, while the
          blissful shrine in my sanctuary above, where I alone reign as
          priestess, invites a united homage!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I bid thee farewell, and will brave the
          storm!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The beautiful
          features of the priestess suddenly froze into an expression of
          scorn and contempt, as she swept quickly out of sight, and the
          valve slammed behind her.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Turning again to
          depart, Marcius had advanced but a step when strains of heavenly
          music floated in from the farther end of the cavern. He lingered
          entranced, while the harmony swelled and diminished with an
          unearthly sweetness which bound him to the spot.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Anon a great
          volume of dense vapor poured up from below, lifting itself by a
          graceful spiral motion, and gaining steadily in density!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Was Alethea yet
          to appear?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yes!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">See!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It gathers
          itself into a defined form! It emerges from its soft background and
          comes forward!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Alethea!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her bosom heaves
          with seeming life, and her eyes glisten with emotion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The form slowly
          dissolved, and Marcius left the Temple, and passed out into the
          storm.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few days after
          the evening excursion of Marcius to the Temple, a little party
          emerged from the house of Benoni into the spacious grounds which
          overlooked the Cydnus. It was soon after mid-day. Though the sun
          shone brightly, a refreshing breeze down the valley from the Taurus
          mountains made the afternoon balmy and delightful. The cool waters
          of the river hurried quietly past, while the sunshine caused the
          ripple which danced upon its surface to gleam like molten gold.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The river barge
          of Marcius, called the Felicia, well manned by stalwart oarsmen,
          waiting at Benoni’s landing by the foot of the terraces, presaged
          an excursion. The group lingered a little, and loitered through the
          grounds to enjoy the clusters of spice-trees, roses, oleanders, and
          jasmine which bordered the winding paths that sloped to the water’s
          edge.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Looking up the
          river, the thick fringes of shrubs and trees which lined its banks
          could be followed by the eye, capriciously zigzag in their course,
          narrowing in the dim distance almost to a thread when traced toward
          the mountain wall of the northern horizon. The distant lofty
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page431">[pg 431]</span><a name=
          "Pg431" id="Pg431" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>range stood out in
          calm, serene beauty, its summits softened by light scattered
          foliage, and kissed by the rays of the afternoon sun.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The band of the
          New Faith in Tarsus had added many to its numbers through the
          labors of Serenus. Seconded by Amabel, and aided by Benoni,
          Rebecca, and Marcius, he was untiring in his work to kindle the
          higher life in the souls who were willing to listen, and the
          synagogue soon became divided between those who were bound by dead
          forms, and the converts to a living spirituality. Works of mercy,
          ministry, and healing abounded, and faith, love, and service were
          multiplied. Such a joy lighted up the faces of the disciples that
          they became familiarly known among the Tarsians as the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“happy brotherhood.”</span> Although the Pharisaic
          members of the synagogue were censorious toward them, they suffered
          no persecution.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An excursion up
          the river had been planned by Marcius, both for the enjoyment of
          the charming scenery, and the opportunity for delightful communion
          and intercourse which come from the society of kindred souls
          possessing a common interest and aim.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides the
          family of Benoni, and Serenus and Amabel, Marcius had invited
          several other friends to join the company, and they gathered at
          Benoni’s house at the appointed hour in readiness for the start.
          After a ramble in the garden, they passed down to the landing to
          embark. Some were already on the barge, when suddenly the sound of
          rapid footsteps was heard, and a young man appeared, hastening to
          reach them before their departure.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page432">[pg 432]</span><a name="Pg432" id="Pg432" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was
          Saulus!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His father,
          mother, and Rebecca were the last of the party, and not yet on
          board.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each was
          successively wrapped in his loving embrace, and tears of joy
          witnessed the warmth of their reunion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Saulus, thou must go with us on the
          excursion!”</span> said Rebecca, as soon as the first greetings
          were over. <span class="tei tei-q">“Serenus and Amabel, also
          Marcius, of whom I have written thee, are already on the
          barge!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Serenus on board! I will go! I long to greet
          him!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon all were
          upon the deck of the Felicia, and at a given signal the twenty oars
          on each side took the water as if by one impulse, and the graceful
          barge glided out upon the bosom of the Cydnus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rebecca
          presented Saulus to Marcius, who received him warmly, and then they
          sought Serenus and Amabel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus and
          Serenus were soon clasped in each other’s arms.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Serenus! my friend, brother, and saviour! Words fail
          me! To thee, whom I once counted as my enemy, I owe my life and my
          salvation. Blessed be these eyes that behold thee, and these ears
          that hear thy voice!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And thou, Amabel! who by my command wast taken to the
          cruel prison! Sister of the New Faith! I need not even ask thy
          forgiveness, for I am persuaded that thou hast bestowed it long
          ago. What a joy to forgive and be forgiven! Rebecca hath written
          the good tidings to me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Felicia was
          headed up stream, but despite the strong current she shot rapidly
          along. The roofs and towers of the city gradually receded, and
          pastoral voices <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page433">[pg
          433]</span><a name="Pg433" id="Pg433" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>and charms grew more distinct and prevailing.
          Delicious exhalations were wafted out from the leaves and blossoms
          of spicy shrubs on either hand, and their graceful forms were
          duplicated in trembling shadows in the clear water beneath. Nature
          furnished a perfect environment of peace and beauty, inspiring in
          the souls of all a revery of silent homage to the Word which she
          articulated and out-pictured.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus and
          Saulus sat down side by side, and all visions of the troubled past
          melted away in their present friendliness and rejoicing. Saulus
          rehearsed to the group which gathered about him a full narrative of
          his thrilling experiences in Damascus, his life and retirement in
          the Desert, and his trials in Jerusalem.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though an
          intensity of brotherly love, like that of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“David and Jonathan,”</span> immediately sprung up
          between Serenus and Saulus, it must not be supposed that they were
          alike, or thought alike. It is often assumed that those who differ
          in natural endowment and personal opinion must in some measure be
          separated in sympathy and interest. Not so. The zealous impetuosity
          of Saulus was in strong contrast with the serenity and evenness of
          his friend. They were utterly dissimilar in looks, temperament, and
          manner of thinking. One might be compared to a dashing, foaming
          cataract, the other to a still, deep river. But their very
          unlikeness stimulated their affection.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every unit is
          composed of unlike elements, and every truth has its widely varying
          aspects. It might therefore be expected that in their efforts to
          spread the New Faith, the methods of these two leaders would be

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay; we have not been molested. The Tarsians have
          little concern either for or against our religion, and our brethren
          of the synagogue, while counting us as heretics and manifesting
          some bitterness of spirit, have done us no harm.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“How unlike Damascus and Jerusalem! Behold in those
          cities all our exhortations in the name of Jesus of Nazareth filled
          the multitudes with jealousy, which brought forth persecution and
          even scourging.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The minds and hearts of men are not speedily

          thou think it strange, O my brother! that those men are moved by
          the same reasoning that, in time gone by, moved thee to persecute,
          thinking that thereby thou wert doing God service? It is no easy
          thing to give righteous judgment concerning the actions of men,
          unless peradventure we have regard unto their ignorance, and all
          their past manner of thinking.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thou sayest truly that I ought not to think it strange
          that others of the Circumcision persecute, even as I did, being of

          be established unless it be boldly proclaimed, whether men hear or
          forbear?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am minded with thee, O Saulus! that the proclamation
          of Truth be fearlessly put forth, but it must be with forbearance
          and in love. Behold the still, small <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          in the affections of men whose ears are closed to argument and
          controversy. If the seed be cast gently into ground that is well
          prepared by the mellowing of love, and watered by the ministry of
          reconciliation, it will spring up, and in due season the blade will
          appear, and finally the full corn in the ear.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thou speakest wisely, O Serenus! for only thy winning
          and unresistant spirit awakened a response in my own heart, that in
          due time overcame me, and turned my feet from the path of error and
          destruction. I am also minded that thy works in Tarsus are far more
          abundant than my vehement logic could have established had I been
          in thy place. Lo, from thy youth up thou hadst a gentleness of
          spirit, which I, even since my change of heart, greatly
          lack.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus turned
          lovingly toward Saulus, and taking him by the hand, replied,—</p>

          lackest. It is well that we have differing talents and gifts. Thou
          canst not perform my work, nor I thine, but there is a harvest
          ripening for each of us. In the earthly vineyard of God the
          shoulders of every laborer are justly fitted to the burden which is
          appointed for him to bear. But of a verity there are no burdens,
          for they are changed to privileges.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tarsus had faded
          from view, and save the rhythmic plash of the oars no sound was
          audible but the hum of quiet converse among the scattered groups
          upon the deck of the Felicia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After listening
          with interest to the conversation between Serenus and Saulus,
          Marcius invited Rebecca’s attention to the grandeur of the
          mountains now nearing as they ascended the river, and soon the
          twain leisurely seated themselves in a retired nook near the bow of
          the boat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The charm of the
          crystal Cydnus burnished by the rays of the sun, its fringed and
          swiftly passing banks, and the reposefulness of the broad, outlying
          landscape, combined to make the whole scene masterful.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“How beautiful the world is!”</span> said Rebecca.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yea,”</span> said Marcius. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Under the inspiration of the New Faith the mountains
          are temples, and the rocks and trees sacred altars which enshrine
          the divine beauty and radiance.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“A beautiful metaphor! I feel that Nature is soulful
          and companionable. The cold, mechanical forms of institutions, and
          the hollow ceremonies in temples made with hands, harden the mind
          and fetter its freedom. As our souls are illumined, Nature becomes
          a Revelation—a spoken Word—transparent to the Divine Spirit which
          shines through it.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius was
          charmed by Rebecca’s poetic consecration, and added,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yea; Serenus teacheth even a threefold Revelation:
          that which shineth through the veil of the outer world; that
          manifested through men—sons of God—of whom <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page437">[pg 437]</span><a name="Pg437" id="Pg437" class=

          the ever-present Spirit, which is the Companion and
          Teacher.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“How clearly the eyes of Serenus are open to the light

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is a marvel!”</span> said Marcius with earnestness.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed be the hour when first I beheld
          him! Behold how great good cometh out of evil! The sinking of the
          Salapiæ hath yielded a great blessing to Tarsus.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          that infinite forces work with us when we work through

          unimportant.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius felt
          that the moment had arrived toward which he had so long looked
          forward as the most eventful of his life.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Rebecca!”</span> said he in a low, tender tone, as
          his eyes glanced upon her fair face, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am
          minded of another great blessing to me which hath grown out of
          evil!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The living
          emphasis of the soft, earnest words seemed peculiar, and Rebecca
          looked up inquiringly, as if to divine their interpretation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold the day of the tumult, when thou wert hard
          pressed by the rabble! What a wicked offence, and yet from it hath
          come to me a revelation of thy beautiful soul.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rebecca was
          startled, for there was an intensity behind the words which swept
          her spirit into unwonted vibration.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Rebecca! I would more fully unveil my heart to thee!

          the time in which I have felt thy goodness and purity! I love thee!
          Thy father hath graciously yielded me permission to make my love
          known to thee. Oh, wilt thou not be the soul of my soul? The New
          Faith will consecrate our love, and make us one in the bonds of a
          union that shall be unending. Should there be no certain response
          in thy heart at this hour, I will not press thee for an answer now.
          But thou art the pure shrine at which my devotion will glow with an
          unending ardor!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the calm
          dignity of Rebecca did not forsake her the beautiful cheeks took on
          a ruddier shade, and her large, radiant eyes were downcast and
          bedewed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, looking
          steadily into his manly face, she replied softly,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hast thou thought carefully of this? Thou art the
          Roman Vice Legate of Tarsus, and I but an humble maid of the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Rebecca, I have pondered it day and night! Never in my
          earlier days did I know there could be such love! But I feel myself
          to be another man—a new man—or I would be unspeakably unworthy of
          thee. I am yet unworthy, but I offer thee the homage of a heart,
          purified I trust, by the higher life, and softened by the
          effulgence of thine own goodness.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a long
          silence, made more intense by the rapid beating of two hearts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A smile upon her
          lips, and the dropping of a tear which would not stay back, gave
          him hope.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unspeakable
          repose filled their souls.</p>

          the sign of Castor and Pollux, entered the Bay of Puteoli laden
          with corn for the granaries of Rome. The mirror-like surface of the
          water brilliantly reflected the rays of the early sun, and
          duplicated the palaces, gardens, and palm-trees which lined the
          banks. The dark-green, vine-clad slopes of Vesuvius, yet a
          slumbering giant, towered up from the eastward above the peaceful
          towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii, distinguished for their brilliant
          color, Greek-like gayety, and beautiful situation. It was one of
          the loveliest of earthly scenes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The luxurious

          which pushed their color and fragrance to the water’s edge, all
          contributed features to form an unequalled earthly paradise. Near

          thrilling classical events and romantic associations of great
          interest in the world’s history. The end of the voyage was at hand,
          and the passengers gathered upon deck to enjoy the complex panorama
          which many of them viewed for the first time. They represented many
          different races, tribes and tongues, and appeared in a picturesque
          variety of costumes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Prominent among

          Julius, who wore the insignia of a centurion, had an intelligent

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was Saulus on
          his journey to the Eternal City upon an appeal for justice. He was
          accompanied by Luke and Aristarchus, though they were not

          the centurion.</p>

          pointed out was as had been represented, and with a soldier for a
          guard, Saulus and his friends were permitted to make the desired
          visit.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The home of
          Marcius occupied one of the most beautiful sites upon the shores of
          the heavenly bay. The water, transparent in its blueness, embraced
          by a lovely sky and an emerald shore, was so serene that it seemed
          to be reposing in a dream of bliss. The air was heavy with the
          odors of flowering plants and shrubs, and a subtle and fascinating
          spell was wont to steal over the senses of the observer. Nature was
          the Charmer.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dark,
          tangled crags to the southwest seemed like lazy yet faithful
          sentinels who were watching lest the prodigal enchantment might
          escape, or that its voluptuousness might tempt the sea to swallow
          it up. What a fairy-land to stir the fancies of the heart, and
          light a smile of rapture upon the face of him whose soul is attuned
          to a beauty that is not only upon the surface, but within!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The three
          friends, who were entirely unlooked for, received a most cordial
          welcome from Marcius and Rebecca, and their home was a veritable
          haven of rest after a long and troublesome voyage. Many years had
          passed since Saulus and Rebecca last met, but the ardor of their
          early affection, if possible, seemed yet increased. <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page444">[pg 444]</span><a name="Pg444" id="Pg444"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Saulus for the first time saw his niece
          Helena, the daughter of Marcius and Rebecca, who was now in the
          bloom of her youthful beauty.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a day of
          hospitable entertainment and intercourse in the unity and spirit of
          the New Faith, the little group, as the sun declined, was seated
          upon the front porch which overlooked the lovely expanse of the
          waters of Puteoli. The air was delicious, and a purple haze
          enveloped the surrounding slopes and heights, softening their
          outlines, and forming a mystical and idealistic setting for the
          splendid summer-houses which dotted the shore and highlands far and
          near. Upon the bay, which reflected upon its bosom the splendor of
          the closing day, here and there might be seen the sail of some
          belated fisherman or pleasure boat, almost becalmed, or perchance
          lazily rowing toward the port.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus, after
          gazing meditatively upon the scene for a little time, broke the
          silence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In all my journeyings I have beheld no scene so
          glorious!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yea,”</span> said Marcius, <span class="tei tei-q">“we
          count it as heavenly as any place on earth well can be. Nearly a
          score of years have taken their flight since we came here from the
          banks of the Cydnus, and yet whenever I return from my journeys in
          other climes it always gives me fresh delight.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Tell me somewhat of thy journeys, and of thy success
          in spreading the New Faith,”</span> said Saulus.</p>

          "tei tei-q">“Behold I have little to make mention of in comparison

          my own manner I feel that my work hath not been in
          vain.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am minded that thou hast devoted most of thy wealth
          to the spread of the new gospel,”</span> said Saulus, <span class=

          effectual service. I would that thou briefly recount to my
          brethren, Luke and Aristarchus, somewhat of thy sacrifices and
          labors for their encouragement.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My sacrifices have been light compared with those
          which each of you has made, yet I have tried to be faithful. To
          this day no persecution hath been meted out to me, but I yet may
          feel the displeasure of Nero. No one can tell. Claudius was content
          with my simple deposition from office in Tarsus, and since that day
          I have lived undisturbed as a Roman private citizen.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Saulus
          desired to hear further.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I have learned through letters from the hand of
          Rebecca that thou hast sent trusted disciples to the ends of the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          his sufferings and death. They say that his blood, though greater
          than other Jewish sacrifices, in the same manner cleanseth from
          transgression and bestoweth pardon.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          beginning to appear among believers, but am fully persuaded that
          the Spirit will not be swallowed up by the letter. A knowledge of
          Jesus, the Christ, after the flesh, profiteth nothing. If I have
          known him after the flesh, I would know him no more.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          belonged to a particular time and place, while the Christ is the
          divine son in all men, even though not yet born into activity. It
          is God in the soul of man!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          ear. Ordinances and sacraments are without, but Christ, the Truth,
          is within. A fleshly and sacrificial belief manifesteth itself in
          form and ceremony, and bringeth forth a harvest of dead works which
          killeth the spirit.”</span></p>

          the Father pertaineth not to time, place, nor race, but must be in
          spirit and in truth. Behold all men, whether Jews or Gentiles, bond
          or free, are blindly feeling after God, but through ignorance they

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Joy reigned in
          the house of Marcius. The unlooked-for arrival of Serenus and
          Amabel brought about a general and happy reunion of friends who
          long had been widely separated.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The abode of
          Serenus was now in Alexandria. As the worthy successor of Philo, he
          was the eminent head of a school of liberal Christian philosophy,
          where teachers and missionaries were trained and educated. The
          academy was not devoted to mere philosophical speculation and
          theorizing, but to the promulgation of the New Faith in its
          pristine purity. Both by precept and example Serenus inculcated a
          practical spiritual life which transformed those who came within
          its moulding influence. The school became a living fountain, from
          which went out the waves of a Christly Christianity. Set free, even
          in greater measure than the Primitive Church, from Jewish
          dogmatism, the truth was purged from all traditional rubbish, and
          given out in all its intrinsic value and beauty. It was the simple
          New Faith, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page450">[pg
          450]</span><a name="Pg450" id="Pg450" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>without any admixture of asceticism, touched
          and gilded by the light of the highest and best Greek philosophy
          and idealism. The influence upon the world at large of the
          Alexandrian liberal school of Christianity, not being recorded in
          canonized history, has been mostly unrecognized in ecclesiastical
          annals.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day after
          the arrival of Serenus and Amabel passed swiftly in mutual converse
          and encouragement. Every one of the reunited circle had much to
          recount. What a wealth of experiences gained, obstacles overcome,
          and inspirations kindled!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Late in the
          evening Marcius felt a strange and unwonted spirit of restlessness.
          All the rest of the household had retired for the night, when some
          intangible but powerful influence almost impelled him to go into
          the open air for a season of meditation and communion with the
          spirit of Nature. Telling Rebecca of his intention, he went out
          upon the porch and took his favorite seat overlooking the beautiful
          bay. The harmony and sublimity of the scene were borne in upon his
          soul, and gave him a sense of profound serenity. The air was soft
          and balmy, and the full-orbed moon was lifting herself above the
          horizon in queenly majesty, lighting up the expanse of waters with
          a sheen of wavy silver.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The arrival of
          Saulus, and yet more that of Serenus and Amabel, brought before the
          mind of Marcius a flood of former associations and emotions
          interwoven with his life upon the banks of the Cydnus. His inner
          experiences of the earlier time passed before him in a procession
          like the unrolling of a scenic panorama. His Christianity was also
          free from a too-prevalent asceti<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page451">[pg 451]</span><a name="Pg451" id="Pg451" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>cism, and the charm of everything about him
          found a response and revelation in his own soul. As he pondered,
          while drinking in the beauty of the night, he measurably divested
          himself of the gross sense of the Physical, and wandered back amid
          bygone soul-experiences. He realized that to penetrate the unseen
          realm of Reality there must be earnest desire, unclouded by the
          opaque objects of sense, usually so all controlling.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He journeyed
          psychically backward, and analyzed his early life,—its selfishness,
          grossness, and superficiality. He thought of those who shared it.
          Where are they now? What occupies them? Have they yet discerned the
          hollowness of the mad pursuit of sensuous gratification?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What of
          Leander?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At that moment
          he was somewhat startled by the dignified approach of a man wrapped
          in a long mantle who came near and called him by name. In a
          reposeful and deliberate manner the stranger leaned against a
          pillar and waited for a response. His voice was musical, his face
          had a pleasant and impressive aspect, indicating refined character
          and a passionless depth of thought, heightened by a noble forehead
          and deep-set eyes.</p>

          hidden herself behind dense masses of floating clouds so that the
          darkness had perceptibly increased, but Marcius was thoroughly
          persuaded of the sincerity of his guide, and did not hesitate.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They started.
          After traversing several narrow streets <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page453">[pg 453]</span><a name="Pg453" id="Pg453" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>and turning many corners, they took a road
          which wound steadily upward. On, on, on!—would they never arrive at
          the journey’s end? The deep obscurity and many turns caused Marcius
          to lose his bearings, and he had little or no idea even of the
          general direction which they had taken. In the gradual ascent they
          crossed two streams upon whose classical banks in bygone ages had
          encamped the invading hosts of Etruscan, Sybarite, and Roman. The
          whole vicinity was rich with ancient lore. Still on, until, with a
          sharp turn to the right, they passed through a deep and narrow
          fissure which parted a hill of rock, and was shrouded by abundant
          foliage.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Emerging from
          the narrow walled passage, immediately before them, upon a level
          plateau, stood a venerable castle. The light which streamed through
          a few of the windows gave evidence of life within.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They entered,
          and after mounting a broad, winding staircase, Marcius was ushered
          into the presence of a tall, dignified and venerable man, with long
          hair and flowing beard of snowy whiteness, who received him with
          becoming and polite cordiality. He was wrapped in a long white
          mantle, heavily embroidered in gold with mystical and occult
          designs. After the first greetings, he motioned Marcius to a
          convenient seat. The room was commodious, and possessed many
          remains of ancient splendor fairly well preserved. It contained
          large tables of costly marble elaborately carved, upon which were
          piles of parchment sheets and rolls, and also many astrological,
          chemical, and philosophical instruments and
          appliances.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page454">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The kindly face

          mind of man. To interpret Nature and Law is to interpret God. We
          must study the adumbration, locution, and the architecture of the

          study of and communion with Nature, or rather her motives and
          internal forces. The second is concerned with the assuagement and
          healing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page456">[pg

          acquaintance with the mysteries and manifestations of Spirit while

          have become excarnate. It includes a study of the laws,
          communications, and unfoldment of human minds and souls. My own

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The thought of

          certain favorable circumstances not commonly understood, may
          briefly draw to themselves some of the finer elements of
          neighboring bodies, and even clothe themselves with them. This is
          no marvel! It is in accord with the spiritual laws of man’s
          constitution. When embodied, Mind commands its own organism. In
          lesser degree, after the seen hath been dropped, its inherent
          forces may lay hold of the subtle elements that are less closely

          expression. But thanks to friendly thought-ministration from
          intelligences more highly developed, both in the visible and
          invisible, progress soon begins, and will continue. The cords that

          retributive and purifying discipline until they finally give way,

          no light save the rays of the full moon which came in brightly
          through two casements, the clouds having dispersed. The door was
          closed, and Marcius shown to a seat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The room was
          octagonal in shape, and of moderate size, except in height, which
          was great in proportion to the other dimensions. Upon the vaulted
          ceiling far above there were dim points of light, which like stars
          seemed to have a luminosity of their own. High above their heads
          small Æolian harps hung in valves which were open to the gentle
          zephyrs without, and they were discoursing soft, sweet melody which
          seemed more like heavenly whisperings than earthly music.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon the Seer
          gave a signal, upon which a man clad in loose white robes entered
          and seated himself upon a dais between the two casements. There was
          sufficient light to show Marcius that the face was that of the
          messenger who had guided him to the castle. The harmony, beauty,
          and softness of the whole scene was so impressive that he awaited
          some demonstration with anxious expectancy. His thoughts turned
          once more back to Alethea, and his heart beat quickly at the memory
          of the vision long ago in the Tarsian <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But see! A
          tremor passes over the frame of the figure upon the dais. His

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius
          marvelled!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same wavy
          brown hair!—dark blue eyes!—fair complexion, with skin white, as if
          polished with baths and oil! His costume was that of an actor in
          dramatic representation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius was
          still more surprised when Leander assumed an oratorical attitude,
          and in his old-time impassioned manner began the recitation of
          Greek poetry. Then followed a scene from one of the tragedies of
          Sophocles. After closing, he waited a moment, as if expecting
          applause.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius almost
          forgot the present in such a realistic dream of the past.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Leander now came
          forward and laid his hand upon the shoulder of Marcius. An
          intensely woeful expression was manifest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Marcius gave him
          a kindly look, and replied,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Think of love, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          to decay before the wonted time! Listen to my iniquity! With more
          gold, by my direction, Colurus was hired to administer the potion
          to thee! But, thanks to all the gods—none of which I have beheld
          since I left the body—thou art here and well! The potion took no
          effect, but, oh, the guilt is not the less! I am tormented beyond
          measure for having so rewarded the best friend I ever had! A fire
          rageth within my thought, and I have no rest! Horror and
          destruction, in living forms, follow and point at me!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He groaned in

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Seer cast a
          benignant glance upon Leander, and said reassuringly,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          are in process of being cast out. Beneficent laws have ordained
          that growth cometh through pain. Virtue is valuable because it
          costs much, and its sweetness cometh from intelligent contrast. As
          Marcius hath well said, only love can heal thy disquietude. But
          time is necessary, for there are no sudden leaps in soul. All
          things grow only from cultivation and desire.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Leander paced
          the room with intense agitation, as if impelled by some evil
          spirit, but at length, by great effort, stopped before Marcius, and
          kneeled with bowed head.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a little
          before mid-day, and the forum and market-place of Puteoli were
          filled with a throng which represented a mingling of different
          races, avocations, and professions. Some were in favorite places of
          resort, passing the hours in <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">dolce far
          niente</span></span>, and even the busy ones moved leisurely under
          the influence of the soft and luxurious atmosphere of southern
          Italy. Life among all classes was spent mainly out-of-doors, or in
          public places like the temples, baths, forum, or porticos. Simply
          to exist in such a climate was a dreamy luxury. The passive
          enjoyment of the present hour barred out any anxious future. If an
          earthquake caused some trembling of the immediate environment
          to-day, they were yet willing to let to-morrow take care for the
          things of itself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here and there
          was a sleek and luxurious Roman noble, a senator, or perchance some
          member of the court of Nero, whose country home was on the coast,
          jostled by merchants and seamen from every clime of the then known
          world. The long toga of the magistrate or lawyer was brushed by the
          picturesque costume of the peasant, the embroidered tunic of the
          pleasure-seeker, or perchance the rags of a beggar.</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page464">[pg 464]</span><a name="Pg464" id="Pg464"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here, as in the
          neighboring cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii, Grecian art had
          taken early root, and frescos, carvings, and other ornate
          decoration covered every available space.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Near the heart
          of the business quarter on the side of a colonnade were the stalls
          of the money-changers, with their shining heaps in full view, which
          were the fruit of exchanges of the coins of many nations, the corn,
          animal products, and merchandise of which were landed here on the
          way to the Eternal City. At intervals the statue of some one of the
          Cæsars, a triumphal arch, a bronze or marble god or goddess, with
          frequent fountains whose iridescent spray danced and sparkled in
          the sunlight, gave variety and artistic beauty to the scene.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Petty traders
          displayed their varied wares, and artificers fashioned their
          handiwork and deftly exercised their different crafts with a
          well-ordered professional skill. The easy-going life of the great
          majority, to outward appearance, seemed like a long-drawn-out
          poetic revery. Gayety and love of pleasure and show glistened on
          the surface of the complex river of life that flowed smoothly
          along.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The temple of
          Jupiter occupied one side of the forum, and a straggling and
          variable procession passed in and out, who came to pay their
          devotions to the chief god of the Roman state. In plain sight of
          the temple, fronting on a narrow street which led from the forum,
          and on the same side, was a plain, square building, somewhat
          resembling a Jewish synagogue. This was the meeting-place of a
          small congregation of the members of the New Faith, which was
          composed of divers races, including a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page465">[pg 465]</span><a name="Pg465" id="Pg465" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>few Jews who had left behind their national
          ceremonialism. The outgoing waves of the new spiritual movement in
          the East had reached this distant shore, and, chiefly through the
          influence of Marcius and Rebecca, had crystallized into an
          organization.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Up to this time
          there had been no dangerous persecution, though much prejudice and
          dishonor had been visited upon the disciples. They had been
          contemptuously designated as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“atheists,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“despisers
          of the fine arts,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“maligners of the
          gods and the temple,”</span> and by common reputation rated as
          disloyal to the <span class="tei tei-q">“divine Cæsar.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great fame
          of Saulus as an apostle, preacher, and healer had long before
          preceded him, and soon the news of his arrival, as a prisoner on
          his way to Rome, became noised abroad. Serenus also, though less
          known to the common people, had much reputation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the day
          already noted, being the fifth after the landing of Saulus, a noisy
          group, composed mainly of idlers who frequented the streets,
          gathered near the meeting-place of the disciples. In the midst of
          the boisterous crowd, a man whose appearance indicated that he was
          of the lower orders, seemed to be the principal subject of an
          animated controversy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He is no other than the cripple!”</span> said one.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He is not the cripple, but is like him!”</span> said
          another.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The man was
          straight, and had full command of his limbs, and began to dance
          with a light step to show his agility. His name was Lausus,
          formerly a sailor, but from the effect of a fall several years
          before had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page466">[pg
          466]</span><a name="Pg466" id="Pg466" class=

          trinkets about the streets until he became familiarly known as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Cripple.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dispute
          continued.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tumult
          increased, and the crowd grew larger.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Down with them! they are dreamers and beside
          themselves!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay, they speak the truth!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Their pretended healings are lies! I have heard that
          they are murderers of new-born babes!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is a slander!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Down with the deceivers! drive them out!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Is it wrong to heal disease?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“They show contempt to Jupiter and all the gods by
          paying homage to a Jew!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The controversy
          grew more bitter, and at length ended with the beating of Lausus,
          and he was left almost helpless; but soon he was borne away by some
          of the brethren. The aid of the twain who had ministered relief
          before was again sought, and he speedily recovered from his
          bruises.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tumult, the
          rumors of healing, their denial and affirmation, with the violent
          aspersion of the doctrines <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page468">[pg 468]</span><a name="Pg468" id="Pg468" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>and practices of the members of the New Faith,
          caused a widespread dispute and division among the people of the
          entire coast. The opposers of the new movement stoutly maintained
          that the examples of healing were temporary and imaginary, and that
          those upon whom the works had been wrought were self-deceived, or
          that they never had been afflicted with any veritable
          disorders.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two visitors
          found themselves the subjects of a great controversy, which grew to
          be so earnest that even the influence of Marcius hardly could
          protect them from insult on one side, and homage and almost
          deification on the other. Their fame spread so rapidly that calls
          came from all directions; and when the day had ended they had
          ministered to scores of sick folk, and brought restoration and
          health into outward manifestation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold your works of mercy have stirred up much
          commotion among the people of Puteoli!”</span> said Marcius, as the
          household gathered at the close of the day’s experiences.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is ever thus!”</span> said Saulus. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The outward signs and fruits which follow and attest
          the glow of the higher life are an inspiration to those who believe
          and accept them, but a rock of offence and stumbling to the
          faithless. The selfsame works, therefore, may bless or curse in due
          measure, according to the manner in which they are
          received.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just then the
          conversation was interrupted by the coming of a messenger, who
          besought Saulus and Serenus to visit a man who was violently
          possessed of an evil spirit. They started immediately, and were led
          for some distance through the darkness of the evening, finally
          halting be<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page469">[pg
          469]</span><a name="Pg469" id="Pg469" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>fore the large and richly appointed
          country-house of a Roman patrician. Entering the spacious court,
          they were met by the wife and a few other friends of the afflicted
          man, who was no other than the owner of the villa.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We have heard of your wonderful works, but wot not by
          what power they are wrought; and now behold the master of the house
          is grievously tormented, and a rich reward will be given if you
          will restore him.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Roman matron
          added her importunate request.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O sirs! he is a kind and upright man when the demon
          doth not possess him! Can you cast out the foul spirit? Behold when
          it useth him he is exceeding fierce, so that he must needs be bound
          with chains. Silver and gold in abundance shall be yours if
          peradventure you can compass his release.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We come not for silver and gold!”</span> said Serenus;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“but in the name of the Eternal Spirit of
          Goodness, to bring joy, peace, and salvation to this house. Thy
          husband shall be restored.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two strong
          attendants led the way, a few steps in advance, to a massive room
          in the basement, where the Roman was securely bound with chains. He
          glared fiercely as they entered, and sprang forward to the full
          length of his bonds to attack them. Serenus and Saulus followed
          immediately behind, and so soon as his eyes rested upon them he
          relaxed and sank quietly into a seat, trembling, and frothing at
          the mouth as if in a fit. He was a large man, and clad in a thick
          leathern garb that he might not wound himself. His manly features
          and noble forehead were distorted with rage, his nostrils
          distended, and his eyes shot out fiery glances until they
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page470">[pg 470]</span><a name=
          "Pg470" id="Pg470" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>softened and partly
          closed at the sight of the unwonted visitors. Soon he sat upright,
          and was in a more quiet but still defiant mood, though he did not
          try again to arise.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus was the
          first to speak.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thou foul and wicked spirit! in the name of the same
          ever-present Christ that had full and visible manifestation through
          Jesus of Nazareth, I command thee to come out of him!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The man was
          shaken as if by a paroxysm, but after much effort opened his
          lips.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Through the mouth of this man I confess unto thee that
          I am both foul and wicked, as thou hast said, and that I must needs
          obey thee!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus turned
          lovingly toward his companion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Brother Saulus, I pray thee, before sending him away
          to darkness and despair, if thou wilt, let us hold brief converse
          with him. Behold is he not bound and in torment, and doth not he
          also need release, even as this Roman?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Serenus, thou speakest with thy wonted wisdom! I
          thank thee, for I thought only of the Roman! With all my long

          from thee. I beseech thee, do what seemeth good in thine own
          eyes.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus then
          came near, and calmly looked into the man’s face.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Why dost thou torment this Roman who hath never done

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Roman
          aroused himself and glanced about him with strange surprise. As he
          slowly arose there was a clanking of chains. He stared in wonder at
          them, and then at his leathern raiment, and looking around awaited
          an explanation. There was a momentary silence as he surveyed his
          strong attendants, and then glanced into the faces of Serenus and
          Saulus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus and
          Saulus then retired to the court of the house, while the attendants
          remained to minister to his immediate necessities, and assist him
          in clothing himself with his own raiment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold thy husband is healed!”</span> said Serenus to

          presently, clothed, and in his right mind.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She bowed
          herself before the twain as if they were some strange gods in human
          form.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O sirs! I bless you for the great favor which you have

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon the Roman
          entered, calm and self-controlled as he was wont long aforetime,
          and clasping his wife in his embrace, they wept for joy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold these are thy saviours!”</span> said the
          matron, pointing to the two friends as soon as the first greetings

          <span class="tei tei-q">“I declared unto them that their God shall

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yea, give God all the glory! Behold we are but

          Serenus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sudden
          recovery of his own consciousness was so strange that the Roman
          marvelled, and much explanation was necessary to make him
          understand the past and what had been wrought within him. His
          gratitude was without measure, and he pressed his new-found friends
          to take a reward, which was refused. After giving him a faithful
          but simple statement of the New Faith, and promising that Marcius
          would come and instruct him more fully, and be his friend after
          their departure from the coast, they returned to the house of their
          host.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the evening
          of the following day the whole household of Marcius was again
          gathered upon the outer porch which overlooked the charming bay.
          The loving circle of friends was to be broken the next morning.
          Perchance some of them might never again view each other’s faces in
          the flesh. Saulus, in the charge of Julius, the centurion, was to
          depart for Rome on his way to trial, accompanied by his friends,
          Luke and Aristarchus. Serenus and Amabel at the same time were to
          take ship for their home in Alexandria.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As they sat
          looking out upon the picturesque cliffs and islets near and
          distant, which were softened by the purple of closing day, there
          was an interval of deep silence, broken only by the rhythmical
          plash of the waves below. All thoughts were centred upon the coming
          separation.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page475">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length
          Marcius turned toward Saulus,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Would that it were some other Cæsar than Nero before
          whose tribunal thou wert to appear! But we will hope all things,
          and believe in all good. Thou art wise and fearless, and the favor
          of God will abide with thee!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Whatever may come to pass, I am persuaded that all
          things whatsoever will work together for good!”</span> replied
          Saulus. <span class="tei tei-q">“We are ministers of the New Faith,
          and look to that, and not to ourselves.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yea, brother Saulus, the paths of duty and privilege
          are one and the same,”</span> said Serenus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thinkest thou that the God of all the earth will
          always protect his own, O Serenus?”</span> said Rebecca.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“All divine laws that pertain to his children are
          beneficent; but if thou hast in mind only bodily protection, it may
          not always be assured, although everything worketh toward that end.
          But, as thou knowest well, even if the body be destroyed it doth
          not harm the real man. While we should strive to care well for our
          bodily manifestation, because it is useful, its loss may be likened
          to the ruin of a house, with its owner unharmed, and a more fitting
          habitation awaiting him.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“As thy departure draweth near, I would fain make
          inquiry concerning a matter of doctrine, that I may have a fuller
          understanding,”</span> said Marcius. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          have heard it said by some that the Messias is again to come in
          visible form, and that the end of all things draweth nigh. What
          thinkest thou of this?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold,”</span> said Serenus, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the end of the world only signifieth the closing of
          the old Dispensation, whether in the world or in each human soul.
          The Messias is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page476">[pg

          the souls of men, and so far as his coming is perfected, it hath
          outward expression, though not fully complete in them as it was in
          the Nazarene. But every man already hath the unspoken Christ, who
          seeketh fuller and visible articulation. The light is within,
          waiting for a refinement of the outer nature in order that it may
          shine through.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There also appear to be certain differences of belief
          among our brethren, concerning the birth, death, and resurrection
          of Jesus!”</span> said Marcius.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“While these are well in the literal and outward sense,
          their importance is contained in the changes which they symbolize
          in the inner nature of man. A belief of the head in the sacrifice
          of the Prophet of Nazareth availeth naught; the Christ mind and
          life must be born in the soul.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“How dost thou view the day of judgment?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          divine Image, or Truth, is a tribunal in every one, and until the

          never ended. No outward legality, sacrifice, or ceremony can
          satisfy, but only an inner conformity to the Model.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What is the life beyond? and is there a spiritual

          the beyond. Such a discipline to the old man, or fleshly self,
          seems like a con<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page477">[pg

          to the lower consciousness.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But, dear friends,”</span> continued Serenus,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“why address all these questions concerning
          the deep things of the Spirit to me? Let Saulus speak of them, and
          we will listen to him.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Friends,”</span> said Saulus with warm earnestness, as
          he grasped the hand of Serenus, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have not
          the abundance of wisdom necessary to teach my brother from whom I
          have learned from the beginning! To Serenus I am beholden for all
          that I am and have! Long ago he saved my life in Jerusalem, when he
          knew that I was his worst enemy. Not his correct doctrine only, but
          his beautiful life, pricked me to the heart, and stirred my soul to
          its depths, and at last kindled the flame of the New Faith within
          me. His example was ever my inspiration; and the Spirit of Truth
          within, which to me is the final authority, hath confirmed to me
          the substance of all his teaching. Blessed be the day, when as his
          earnest but mistaken opponent in the academy of Gamaliel, I first
          beheld his goodly face!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The spontaneous
          and eloquent testimony of Saulus touched a tender chord in every
          heart. Marcius was deeply affected, and pressed forward and took
          the other hand of the beloved disciple.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Dear Serenus! to thee I also am beholden for
          everything! I beg thee to receive my testimony and blessing.
          Stained in my early years with the vice and sensuality of the
          Tarsian metropolis, I was at length renewed by the New Faith, which
          thou awakened within me. It not only transformed my life, but
          brought to me the dearest <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page478">[pg

          man. I am minded that thou cravest no praise, but am deeply moved
          to speak the simple truth!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Rebecca,
          whose face shone with joy, essayed to speak.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Serenus beckoned
          for silence, but the current which had broken forth was not to be
          stayed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The birth of the New Faith in my soul began with the
          converse I had with thee after thou hadst saved my life on the day
          of the Temple panic! Thy life, while I dwelt in the Holy City, and
          at Tarsus also, was my unfailing example and
          inspiration!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What was left
          for Amabel?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She stepped
          forward, and grasping her husband in a warm embrace, wept great
          tears of joy. Words could not be found, but silence was more
          eloquent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a little
          past mid-day, after a toilsome journey, that Julius, with his
          notable prisoner, accompanied by Luke, Aristarchus, and a few
          soldiers, approached the city of the Cæsars. From the summit of a
          rise in the Appian Way, a few miles distant, Saulus had the first
          view of the place of his fateful residence. The long wall of blue
          Sabine mountains, with Soracte in the distance, enclosed the broad
          Campagna, which stretched across to the sea and around the base of
          the Alban hills. The great city seemed blended in one
          indiscriminate mass of color, in which were mingled every grade and
          variety of human domiciles, with colossal baths, temples, theatres,
          colonnades, and palaces, relieved by the gilded domes and roofs
          which flashed forth the brightness of the warm afternoon sun. As
          they approached the emporium, the great thoroughfare became more
          confusing and thronged. It seemed like a mighty, swift-flowing
          river with counter currents. Chariots, richly carved and gilded,
          drawn by three or four horses abreast, two and four wheeled
          vehicles of all qualities, luxurious litters, inlaid with mother of
          pearl, carried upon the shoulders of slaves, whose proud occupants
          looked down upon pedestrians, horsemen, and footmen <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page482">[pg 482]</span><a name="Pg482" id="Pg482"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of all nationalities, soldiers and
          civilians, patricians and beggars, formed a dense and endless
          moving panorama. It was the pulsation of the main artery near the
          heart of the world. On either side were countless tombs,
          architecturally beautiful, containing numerous bas-reliefs and
          inscriptions, including those of the Scipios, Cæcilia Metella, and
          others of notable fame, with endless statues, columns, and other
          stately memorials.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many an eye
          glanced with disdainful curiosity upon the chained Saulus and his
          little knot of Jewish sympathizers, as they threaded their way
          among the crowd with an escort of soldiers. At length in the
          distance they catch sight of the imperial palaces on the Palatine
          Hill, and still beyond, crowning the summit of Capitolinus, the
          Capitol, or Tabularium. Soon they pass by the fountain of Egeria,
          thence by the pyramid of C. Cestius, under the arch of Drusus, and
          through the Capenian gate. Turning abruptly to the right at the
          Circus Maximus, their route is lined with temples, triumphal
          arches, baths, and statues, until they finally reach the barracks
          of the Prætorian guard, which was always kept close at hand for the
          immediate service of Cæsar.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus, by his
          own appeal, was now at the seat of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page483">[pg 483]</span><a name="Pg483" id="Pg483" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>the governmental and military power of the
          earth. Even though coming as a prisoner, a long dream of his life
          was now accomplished. He was in Rome.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Julius left his
          prisoner with the guard at the entrance to the barracks, and made
          his way to the office of Africanus Burrus, the Prætorian Præfect,
          to announce the termination of his long and successful commission.
          After the usual military salute, the centurion began his
          report,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Præfect! I come to make known my return from Cæsarea
          with the prisoner Saulus, in charge of whom I was sent, and now he
          is here, ready to be delivered into thy keeping.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is well! I commend thee that thine arduous service
          hath been accomplished. But so long a time hath passed since I was
          informed concerning this case that I have forgotten about the
          nature of the charge. I must consult the records.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the scribe
          of the Præfect was searching the docket, Julius continued his
          verbal report,—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The man is a Jew, but hath the rights of Roman
          citizenship. After being tried by Agrippa, he appealed unto
          Cæsar.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ah, yes! I now call him to mind. He is the one who
          stirred up such a commotion among the Jews at Jerusalem and
          Cæsarea. He was charged with preaching a strange faith, and
          worshipping some unknown god. Was he also answerable for speaking
          against the authority of Cæsar?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay; his political loyalty was unquestioned! His only
          real offence was some violation of Judaism. There was a great

          id="page484">[pg 484]</span><a name="Pg484" id="Pg484" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>and even death. Their national religion
          appears to be peculiarly bigoted and intolerant. I am minded that
          King Agrippa found no real fault in him. I heard that it was
          declared both by Festus and Agrippa that the man had done nothing
          worthy of death or even bonds, and that he might have been set free
          had he not appealed to Cæsar. Feeling the injustice of the
          accusations which came from his own countrymen, he nobly sought the
          highest tribunal.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He must be an uncommon prisoner, and I shall accord

          "tei tei-q">“I rejoice in that! Though a chained prisoner, he is
          the wisest and most marvellous man that I have ever known. He is
          gifted with more knowledge, even about sailing a ship, than the

          should have been spared a shipwreck, and even then, but for his

          board would have perished.”</span></p>

          the Præfect thoughtfully; <span class="tei tei-q">“but how
          unfortunate that a man of such superior wisdom should be a devotee
          of a strange and superstitious religion!”</span></p>

          men. But it would seem that much learning hath made the man

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          through his God, to heal the sick and cast out foul spirits, and
          both at Melita and Puteoli he did many wonderful works. The
          inhabitants were unwilling to part with him.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Julius then
          handed to Burrus the sealed parchments that were sent by Festus and
          King Agrippa. The Præfect broke the seals, and carefully read the
          contents.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I perceive that this is an unwonted and prejudiced

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          been made known to me that a vessel which sailed from Cæsarea soon
          after ours was lost in the same terrible storm in which we were
          shipwrecked. Peradventure some of the accusers of Saulus were
          aboard of her.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The centurion
          left and soon returned, conducting his prisoner into the presence
          of the Præfect. Saulus showed signs of his many hardships, and his
          face looked like one whose life had been exposed to many strains
          and shocks. His hair was gray, his brow furrowed, and his cheeks
          hollow, but his eyes were bright and piercing. While unattractive
          in form and feature, there was an indescribable light and vigor
          within, which seemed to shine through the flesh, and impress and
          attract the most careless beholder.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“This is thy prisoner, O Præfect, Saulus of
          Tarsus!”</span> said Julius.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus gave the
          Præfect a proper greeting.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The report of the centurion to which I have listened

          journey, thou dost need rest and refreshment, so for the present I
          will send thee to thy quarters.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus thanked
          the Præfect for his kindly words.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A Prætorian was
          directed to take him to a comfortable outer room in the best part
          of the prisoners’ quarters, and the order was given that he be
          allowed to hire a house in the vicinity for himself, if he so
          desired, until the time of his trial.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Beyond the
          Tiber, in a district mostly squalid and miserable, there had grown
          up a large community of Jews. It was the residential section of the
          rabble, and headquarters for the most ignoble trades and poorest
          merchandise. Although low and thoroughly despised by the Romans,
          but a small portion of the Hebrews were slaves. At this time
          toleration was general, and both they and the Christians enjoyed
          immunity from disturbance in their synagogue services.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As ever before
          and since, the Jewish element was distinct and unamalgamated.
          Through all the ages they have been a standing wonder,—a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“peculiar people.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as
          Saulus was settled in Rome, in order that his countrymen might not
          misunderstand his position, he lost no time in inviting their
          principal men—the rulers and elders of the synagogues—to meet him,
          so that he might disabuse them of prejudice, which many of them
          already had concerning him. They were sharply divided into parties
          and sects. There were Jews of the old order, who were hostile to
          Christianity; Judaizing Christians, or such as nominally accepted
          the Prophet of Nazareth, but clung to ceremonialism; and a few
          con<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page488">[pg 488]</span><a name=
          "Pg488" id="Pg488" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>verts to the New
          Faith, who nearly or quite disregarded the traditional code. With
          such incongruous elements Saulus began his labors, striving upon
          the basis of essential truth to harmonize their discords and make
          peace.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the time
          appointed, which was only three days after his arrival, the room of
          Saulus was crowded with the principal representatives of the
          various sects which he had invited to meet him. While intending to
          preach the gospel both to Jew and Gentile, he was minded to begin
          by an effort to conciliate the feelings of his Hebrew brethren both
          toward himself and the New Faith. He came at once to the point, as
          soon as his auditors were convened, and began his address.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Brethren and friends! I would make known unto you that
          I am no traitor to our nation because I have appealed to the Roman
          power. It hath been rumored among you that I have come to Rome as
          an accuser of the Sanhedrin before Cæsar. But instead, I have come
          to defend myself against its enmity. The chief priests and elders
          invoked the lower tribunals of the foreign power, and thus
          compelled me to appeal to the supreme authority for justice and
          vindication. I have committed no offence against Israel, or the
          customs of our fathers, yet my countrymen delivered me up with
          accusations of sedition and blasphemy.</span></p>

          firm faith in the deliverance of his people through the Messiah,
          foretold and promised by the prophets of old. I am set for the
          defence of the gospel, not by envy and strife, but through love and
          good-will, that it may abound unto all nations and to you-ward.
          Behold the covenant which the God of glory made with our father
          Abraham, and the testimony to Moses while in the wilderness to
          raise up a Prophet unto us, and the Holy One spoken of by Isaiah,
          all are fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth! As foretold, he was put to
          death, and opened not his mouth against his enemies. I beseech you,
          do not vainly continue to look for a warlike Messiah, who, through
          garments rolled in blood, shall restore only a seen kingdom,
          whereby the things of this world prevail! Behold in due season a
          spiritual dominion cometh which shall fill the whole earth! Carnal
          weapons must give place to the sword of the Spirit, until all
          nations shall be brought under the mild sway of the Prince of
          Peace. The Prophet of Nazareth laid the foundation for an Universal
          Kingdom, but its coming will be without observation.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I might persuade you by arguments without end, drawn
          from your own Scriptures, of the truth of the spiritual faith which
          I proclaim! I could fill your ears with the warnings, promises, and
          inspirations of the ancient patriarchs, law-givers, singers, and
          prophets that have arisen among our own people. I beseech you,
          therefore, to lay aside every prejudice, and no longer dwell in
          dead forms and ceremonies. I would that ye be transformed by the
          renewing of your minds through <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          give heed unto the words I have spoken, and declare unto you that
          it is for the hope of Israel that I am bound with this
          chain!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instead of
          bringing peace, the earnest appeal of Saulus increased the
          dissensions among his auditors.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was ever
          thus. Truth, when launched into the midst of error and prejudice,
          unfailingly stirs them up, and brings their bitter dregs to the
          surface. There is far more hope of winning an honest sceptic than a
          self-satisfied bigot. The Gentiles, or heathen, finally proved much
          more accessible to the New Faith than the Chosen People themselves,
          although the number of Hebrew Christians somewhat increased.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a heated
          discussion, the larger part of the audience withdrew, and a formal
          separation took place between them and the <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the two
          years that the trial of Saulus, for various reasons, was delayed,
          he remained in his own hired house, and was permitted much liberty
          in proclaiming the power of the gospel to all who came to him. He
          also wrote important letters to the churches of the East. But he
          was still a prisoner, chained by the arm, both night and day, to a
          Prætorian. Many of the rough soldiers who guarded him were moulded
          by his influence, and thoroughly transformed in life and character
          by the spiritual righteousness which he awakened within them. Even
          some of the household of Cæsar and a few patricians were touched to
          the heart by the halo of the divinity which shone out through the
          personality of the great Apostle.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          of heaven, so the seed of a spiritual tree was scattered in the

          after these words fell from the lips of Nero, the notable prisoner
          was led into the basilica of the imperial palace.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The room, of
          magnificent grandeur, was of great size and perfect proportion. The
          pavement, in mosaic designs of wonderful pattern and finish, was a
          masterpiece of skill, in which serpentine, onyx, and porphyry were
          artistically blended. A long row of lofty white marble columns,
          containing zones of blended pale green, stretched down the length
          of the hall on either side, and the walls were inlaid with giallo
          antico, lapis lazuli, and other fine marbles of variegated shades,
          which came from the mountains near Pisa. The broad cornices of
          alabaster were covered with a wealth of mythological figures carved
          in strange and grotesque design. The arched roof, of imposing
          height and of a deep blue shade, was so studded with golden points
          as to represent the evening heavens. The outer spaces beyond the
          columns were filled with statues in bronze, silver, gold, ivory,
          alabaster, and marbles, many of which were the fruits of
          despoliation in various cities of the East. Mingled with the
          statues were rare flowers in graven or <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          tables of citron.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nero’s gold and
          ivory chair, in which he half reclined, was at the centre of the
          apse, which projected from the eastern end of the basilica. Broad,
          polished steps of porphyry, with a white marble balustrade on each
          side, led up to the seat of the imperial judge. A little to his
          right, in a place of special honor, an ivory cabinet, inlaid with
          mother of pearl, contained his poems, tragedies, and orations,
          which he counted of priceless value to the world; and near by hung
          his golden harp, adorned with precious stones, upon which, in the

          audiences.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ranged in a
          double row below him on either side stood his special guard of
          Prætorians, whose silver eagles and gilded uniforms gave glitter
          and pomp to every official sitting, whether important or otherwise.
          Clustered a short distance behind him stood a group of tall
          lictors, whose shining axed fasces symbolized a power which none on
          earth could dispute.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus was
          placed at a little distance in front of Nero, upon a spot marked by
          a different color in the pavement, and known as the prisoners’
          circle. His chain was upon him, and there was no friend by his
          side.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the right and
          left, on raised seats, and nearly in front of the imperial chair,
          was the council of Assessors, twenty in number, who were all men of
          high rank. Among them were the two consuls and the selected
          representatives of other magistracies of Rome, while the remainder
          consisted of senators, chosen by lot.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Saulus took
          his place, Nero looked down languidly, as if impatient at such an
          interruption in the work of revising a new tragedy, in which he had
          great pride. He wore a white tunic and a toga of rare purple, and
          upon his head a laurel wreath. His eyes were dull and bloodshot,
          and his low, flat head, square jaw, flabby double chin, and thick
          neck combined to give him an unmistakable canine cast of
          countenance. His fat white hands looked waxy from constant bathing
          and polishing, which was submitted to in order that their
          suppleness might be improved for harp-playing. Mingled plainly in
          his face were colossal vanity, cruelty, suffering, and silliness.
          He was not naturally a fool, but his talent had become strangely
          abnormal. Though yet young in years, they had been long enough to
          transform a man into a monster. He blinked as he turned his head
          from side to side, as if the air were thick with bloody spectres
          that he could not avoid, and from whom he expected an assault.
          Disordered in mind and body, he was distracted by physical pains
          and psychical hallucinations. Guilt had honeycombed him, and in a
          tragic manner he often told his intimates that he was haunted by
          all the Furies. But though a profligate and buffoon, he was lord of
          all the Roman legions, and through them the world was at his
          feet.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nero called upon
          one of his consuls to read the indictment. It was briefly summed up
          in three charges.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“First, the prisoner, Saulus, is accused of disturbing

          them by Roman law.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Temple.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Third, it is claimed that he violated the public peace
          by seditious agitation, as the leader of a factious sect which is
          treasonable to the authority of Rome.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Saulus was asked
          to enter a plea concerning the indictment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">not

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nero looked down
          contemptuously upon the prisoner, and took but a sluggish interest
          in the charges. He showed plainly by his manner that the whole
          affair was too trivial to be worthy of more than a passing notice.
          Of the Jewish religion he knew little and cared less. The idea that
          this poor fanatic, with no armed following, was a menace to the
          peace of the Empire was preposterous. Nevertheless, he must keep up
          the forms of justice, and the trial proceeded.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The witnesses
          who had come from Cæsarea were examined, and the papers in the
          case, which had been sent by Agrippa, read by the consul. It was
          plain to every one that the evidence was partial, and even
          contradictory. After the prosecution had been fully heard, Nero
          again cast his eyes indifferently upon Saulus.</p><span class=

          "tei tei-q">“With the consent of Cæsar, I would be heard briefly in
          my own behalf!”</span> replied Saulus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the
          Apostle could but recoil from the character and personality of his
          judge, he was the man to respect the dignity which belonged to an
          exalted office. He began his reply in a manner courteous, calm, and
          respectful. Years of discipline had softened his native
          impetuosity, and given him thorough poise and self-command.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I appear before this supreme tribunal, O Imperator,
          with assurance that I shall find complete justice at thy hands. As
          the fountain of government and power in this, the greatest Empire
          the world hath seen, I am persuaded that thou mayest look with
          indifference upon the small jealousies of Judean sectarianism. I
          might confidently rest my case before thee almost wholly upon the
          discordant and even contradictory testimony of my accusers. I call
          thee to witness, O Cæsar, that King Agrippa, who hath much
          knowledge of the religion of our nation, found me guiltless of the
          charges for which I am called to make answer! Behold the whole

          the Nazarenes, which the scribes and elders call a heretical sect,
          but of a truth, we worship the God of our fathers. We accept the
          things which are written in the law and the prophets when truly
          interpreted, and peradventure it be allowable to have sects of
          Pharisees and Sadducees among the Jews, there is nothing more
          illegal in the existence of the Nazarenes. Behold it is but a
          question of religious liberty, which Rome, to her honor, guarantees
          to all her subjects. I have in all this controversy a conscience
          void of offence toward God and man!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nero moved
          uneasily, but made no interruption.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The second accusation, alleging the profanation of the
          Temple, hath no foundation. Behold my visit was only in discharge
          of sacred duty, and I made no tumult with any man! Such a strange
          charge hath not been proven, and cometh only from the prejudice of
          the Sadducees. I have always held honor toward the Temple of our
          fathers, and in no way profaned its courts or
          ordinances.</span></p>

          remembrance that they who have complained against me are all Jews,
          and that no Roman in all Judea, who is set by the authority of

          never will be found disloyal!</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A look of
          strange surprise at the audacity of Saulus passed like a flash over
          the faces of the spectators, and all eyes were turned toward Nero
          to see its effect upon him. But the outburst of the Apostle had
          been so evidently spontaneous and sincere that Cæsar was
          momentarily touched. His flabby features turned paler and more
          constrained than was wont, and moisture appeared in his heavy eyes
          as they were staringly fastened upon his prisoner. Instead of
          resentment, he seemed fascinated by so strange a human
          phenomenon.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          him, he hopeth and prayeth for thy salvation!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The auditors
          were yet more astounded, and expected to see Nero fly into a rage
          at the closing words of Saulus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tables were
          turned, and behold the great Apostle was in the judgment-seat, and
          Cæsar the prisoner!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there was
          only gentleness in the tones of Saulus, and the earnest love of man
          for his fellow-man shone <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page499">[pg

          Such a warm spiritual brightness lighted up his features that the
          Lion of Rome was both awed and softened.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The trial closed
          with hasty formality. The Assessors by a large majority voted for

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again Saulus was
          face to face with Nero. Since his first acquittal the Apostle had
          made long and important missionary journeys, laboring earnestly for
          the spread of the New Faith. But at length, upon the testimony of
          informers, he was arrested by the magistrates of Nicopolis, and
          again sent to Rome for trial before Cæsar.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Great events had
          taken place in the world’s metropolis since the former trial. A
          conflagration—probably instigated by Nero—had destroyed nearly half
          the city, and the Christians were charged with the wholesale
          incendiarism. Their number was now considerable, and they had
          become recognized as a peculiar sect, distinct from the Jews, and
          were popularly counted as grossly superstitious and disloyal.
          Bitterness and persecution were meted out to them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instead of
          living in his own hired house, as aforetime, Saulus was
          incarcerated in the dungeon of the Mamertine prison, and his
          friends were denied the privilege of visiting him. But his
          indomitable spirit rose above all outward things, and his last
          letter, written to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page501">[pg
          501]</span><a name="Pg501" id="Pg501" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>Timotheus while on the verge of the Unseen, is
          full of triumph. Pessimism, doubt, and fear had no place in his
          soul. There was no such thing as defeat.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With perfect
          confidence in the inherent power of Truth, and its final supremacy,
          he was aware that its progress was not dependent upon the bodily
          continuance of himself or any other person.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During his final
          hours in the seen form he was calm and joyful. Even the sleep of
          his last night on the rock floor of his dungeon was sweet and
          refreshing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The final scene,
          which took place in the early morning, was secret and sudden.
          Saulus, with the few who had him in charge, passed out upon the
          Appian Way, through the gate, which after nineteen hundred years is
          yet called by his name, by the pyramid of C. Cestius, and on about
          three miles, to a green and level spot known as Aquæ Salviæ, where
          they halted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The face of the
          martyr already shone with a heavenly light! He had ascended a Mount
          of Transfiguration, and his inner vision was opened! The realm of
          physical sensation and suffering was left behind, and now he looks
          out and up, and behold the whole Invisible is visible! He has
          already landed upon the Delectable Shore! Here is a new and real
          Universe!</p>

              Temperaments of ardent and imaginative quality are swayed with
              an overpowering desire to delve into the future and unseen. We

              temporary protection which had been extended to the rising sect
              by such men as Gamaliel was now at an end. Pharisees and

              passages from the New Testament (Revised Edition) are
              noted:—</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Acts viii.
              3. But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house,
              and haling men and women committed them to prison.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Acts ix. 1,
              2. But Saul, yet breathing threatening and slaughter against
              the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, and asked
              of him letters to Damascus unto the synagogues, that if he
              found any that were of the Way, whether men or women, he might
              bring them bound to Jerusalem.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Acts xxii.
              4. And I persecuted this Way unto the death, binding and
              delivering into prisons both men and women.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Acts xxvi.
              10, 11. And this I also did in Jerusalem: and I both shut up
              many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from
              the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my
              vote against them. And punishing them oftentimes in all the
              synagogues, I strove to make them blaspheme; and being
              exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto
              foreign cities.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Galatians i.
              13. For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the
              Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church
              of God, and made havock of it.</p>

              the Apostle; and we are sure that—like Moses, like Elijah, like
              our Lord Himself, like almost every great soul in ancient or
              modern times to whom has been intrusted the task of swaying the
              destinies by moulding the convictions of mankind,—like Sakya
              Mouni, like Mahomet in the cave of Hira, like St. Francis of
              Assisi in his sickness, like Luther in the monastery of
              Erfurdt—he would need a quiet period in which to elaborate his
              thoughts, to still the tumult of his emotions, to commune in
              secrecy and in silence with his own soul.... Even on grounds of
              historic probability, it seems unlikely that Saul should at
              once have been able to substitute a propaganda for an
              inquisition.... And so Saul went to Arabia—a word which must, I
              think, be understood in its popular and primary sense to mean
              the Sinaitic peninsula.”</span></p>

              miles distant, may be mentioned as an illustration in this
              line, among thousands with which history abounds. While in
              Gottenburg on the 19th of June, 1759, he saw and described in

              account of this transaction (Acts xxii. 17-21) is brief and
              natural, and there is no claim or indication that the trance
              was peculiar or miraculous. Paul, in his visions, guidances,
              and miracles, never assumed to be more than human, or unlike
              other imperfect men, in his experiences.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Has anything
              done greater harm to the Bible than the glamour that has been

              the events therein related and those which are common to all
              mankind? The laws which govern the psychical, moral, and
              spiritual experiences of men are uniform and unchangeable.
              Otherwise the whole higher economy is chaotic and
              unreliable.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If an
              exalted vision of the Divine, a guidance from the inner Spirit
              of Truth, a miracle of healing, or an interview with one who
              has passed into the Unseen—one or all of these—is possible in

              Its teachings and history would be spiritually natural and
              evolutionary. The grandest work of the present time is its
              rescue from the literalism, strangeness, and dehumanization
              with which it has been burdened. It is thereby honored and made
              congruous. The multitude of warring sects has come from its
              literalization. It is a natural and simple record of the
              experiences of men of varying condition, some of whom were
              spiritually developed in eminent degree. It is inspired because

              freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
