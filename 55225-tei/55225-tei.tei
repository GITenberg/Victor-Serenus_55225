<head>PREFACE</head>

<p>
It seems unnecessary to suggest that this book is entirely
independent of the conventional lines of the modern
realistic novel. To any who hold that idealism in
fiction is not artistic, that a didactic element is inadmissible,
and that philosophizing has no place, the work
will hardly commend itself. To others, who believe that
fiction may be a useful vehicle for the conveyance of
helpful ideals, and even abstract truth, it is offered with
the hope that it may furnish some measure both of entertainment
and profit.
</p>

<p>
On many historical and chronological points that are
involved, authorities differ; but so far as the author has
been able to sift them, the prevailing and apparently
most probable hypotheses have been followed. As may
be inferred, it has been necessary to glean in many fields
for the facts, opinions, and conclusions that make up
the historic portion of the raw material from which this
story has been fabricated.<note place="foot">Besides the history contained in the New Testament Scriptures, the
grateful obligations of the author are due, in varying degree, to Farrar’s
<q>Life and Work of St. Paul,</q> his <q>Darkness and Dawn;</q> the <q>Life and
Epistles of St. Paul,</q> by Conybeare and Howson; <q>Paul the Missionary,</q>
by the Rev. W. M. Taylor, D.D.; <q>The Ideas of the Apostle Paul,</q> by Rev.
James Freeman Clarke, D.D.; various works by Stanley, Jowett, Arnold,
Martineau, Lytton, and Brewer; besides Josephus, Strabo, and other ancient
historical authorities.</note>
</p>

<pb n='vi'/><anchor id='Pgvi'/>

<p>
A majority of the characters being creations, and a
large part of the action also unhistoric, it must be left to
the judgment of the reader how well they fit into their
historic frame-work. So far as St. Paul is introduced
in the narrative, nearly everything delineated belongs to
those portions of his life which are but very briefly or
incidentally touched upon, either in the Scriptural writings
or other history. But utilizing many undoubted realities,
the aim has been to fill in the wide blanks with that
which is in accord and in the line of the possible or
probable.
</p>

<p>
The author has intended to respect the hallowed associations
which cluster about the name of the great
Apostle. But Paul was a man with like passions as
other men, and to be faithful, any outline of the forces
that played through his great soul should be drawn
naturally, and without that misleading glamor often imposed
by far-away time and distance. Only by such
a treatment can his life be brought near, and its practical
lessons enforced. If to any the interpretation
seem unduly broad, they may be assured that the author
has no iconoclastic intent, but on the contrary, an aim
which is wholly constructive, whereby everything wholesome
and uplifting in human life may be encouraged
and strengthened.

<head>CHAPTER I<lb/>A RELIGIOUS PROCESSION IN TARSUS</head>

<p>
In an ancient city, late in the afternoon of a warm
day in early autumn, a little procession was winding its
way through the narrow crowded streets. The calm,
measured pace and solemn countenances of the group
plainly indicated its character as a religious ceremonial.
Slightly in the lead were two priests, of such official
and dignified mien that they appeared as though they
knew the God of Israel face to face. It was as if the
little Hebrew band, in threading a great throng of Gentiles,
were laden with the accumulated weight of all the
traditions of the Chosen and Circumcised since the
time of Abraham. The reverberation of every sandal,
as it struck upon the well-worn pavement, proclaimed,
as loudly as words, <q>We are separate.</q> Even the flocks
of pigeons that were in the air seemed to hover over
the moving column, as if to lend the gleam of their
white wings to its stately rhythm.
</p>

<pb n="2"/><anchor id="Pg002"/>

<p>
The priests wore tall turbans of cup-shaped form,
and were clad in long robes having broad borders decorated
with a deep fringe, and gathered about the body
with an ornamented girdle. Broad phylacteries, square
in form, were bound by thongs, one upon the forehead,
and one upon the left arm, each containing inscribed
passages from the Law. They also wore embroidered
ephods covering the back and breast, held together on
the shoulders by brooches of onyx stones richly set
in gold, and fastened below by a black band garnished
with jewels. Their hands were crossed upon the breast,
and eyes turned toward heaven.
</p>

<p>
Following just behind the priests were men and women
in costumes such as were usually worn in the synagogue,
which indicated that they were returning from a sacred
service. At intervals the low, monotonous tones of a
religious chant, or some soft rendering of passages from
the Mosaic ritual, might have been audible to those in
the near vicinity. They formed an embodied fragment
of that long line of the faithful, who forget not the patriarchs
and the lawgivers, and whose eyes are always
turned towards Jerusalem and the Temple.
</p>

<p>
In the arms of one of the women was a young infant,
and around this least personage there seemed to gather
an interest which showed that whatever the nature of the
service just concluded, the babe must have been the central
figure. The fond glances of the women and evident
attention of the men plainly revealed that thorough satisfaction
which comes from holy duty well performed.
</p>

<p>
The city of Tarsus was the place, and the time about
the middle of the first decade of the Christian era.
<pb n="3"/><anchor id="Pg003"/>Tarsus was a great commercial metropolis. It was
located in the midst of a broad, fertile plain which
mainly made up the province of Eastern or Flat Cilicia,
as distinguished from Rugged Cilicia which bordered
it on the north and west. The prolific soil, central location,
and peculiar physical configuration, all tended
to give it great political importance. Leading from the
great plain through the high barrier of mountains which
sweep from the coast irregularly around it are two passes,
one leading up to the interior of Asia Minor, and the
other giving access to the valley of the Orontes. It was
naturally the meeting-place, and on the highway of trading
caravans and military expeditions. Through this
richly historic country, Cyrus marched to depose his
brother from the Persian throne. It was on this plain
that Alexander gained his decisive victory over Darius.
Here have since been encamped the great hosts of
western crusaders, and indeed, from the early dawn of
history, this plain was the theatre of great events and
conflicts, which had much to do with the shaping of empires,
and the progress of the world’s civilization.
</p>

<p>
The cold and rapid river Cydnus, fed by the snows of
the Taurus range of mountains, flows through this fertile
country; and Tarsus, the capital of the whole province,
which was <q>no mean city,</q> was located upon its banks.
Its coins reveal its importance during the period between
Xerxes and Alexander, and also while under
Roman sway, when it was dignified by the name of Metropolis.
Strabo says that in all that relates to philosophy
and general education it was more illustrious than
Athens or Alexandria. In the main it had the character
<pb n="4"/><anchor id="Pg004"/>of a Greek city; and the Grecian language, literature,
and philosophy were generally cultivated. But there
were also many Romans, Hebrews, Persians, and Syrians,
with a sprinkling of other tribes and peoples, such
as characterized an Oriental metropolis. On its busy
wharves were great piles of merchandise, surrounded by
groups of merchants and traders in many costumes, and
speaking a variety of dialects.
</p>

<p>
It was one of the most important epochs of history;
a time when colossal personalities and events were
stamping their impress upon the destiny of races and
nations. The shores of the Mediterranean formed the
heart of the world’s civilization; and Roman militarism,
legality, and control were permeating and compacting
that great empire, east and west. The Greek and Hebrew
were important but subordinate elements in the
human conglomerate of that eventful period. Various
and unlike races were commingling; their customs and
even their religions were shading into each other, and
their languages becoming considerably interchangeable.
The Roman represented law, government, conquest, and
dominion; the Greek the more subtile ideals of philosophy,
art, and intellectuality; while the Hebrew, intense
and tenacious, was unconsciously laying the foundation,
through his religious zeal, for the coming spread of
Judaism’s great outgrowth, rival, and successor, Christianity.
His hard religiosity and punctilious ceremonialism
were not perceptibly softened even by close
contact with Grecian poetry and idealism. Even Roman
jurisprudence on the one hand, and idolatry on the other,
could not penetrate them. As a rule, the various 
tribu<pb n="5"/><anchor id="Pg005"/>taries to the great current of human history in its evolutionary
course gradually mingle, each adding something
of its own hue to the common volume, but the Hebraistic
economy was the rare exception. Its oil would not mix
with the general water of other systems.
</p>

<p>
At the particular time with which we are dealing, general
peace prevailed. There was one of those alternations
of calmness which intervene between the fierce
storms of racial conflict and religious strife and persecution.
</p>

<p>
The Jewish procession, small in numbers, but important
in spirit and destiny, threaded its way through the
winding thoroughfares, attracting but a passing glance
from the cosmopolitans which made up the multiform
currents of every-day life in Tarsus. At length it halted
in front of a family residence in the better part of the
Hebrew quarter, into which one of the priests with the
father of the child entered, followed by the mother with
her young son in her arms, while the others dispersed.
The babe, Saulus Paulus, was forty days old, and, in
conformity to the Jewish ritual, had been taken to the
synagogue for the prescribed presentation service.
</p>

<p>
Before leaving the household, the priest tenderly took
the child in his arms to give him a final blessing. Raising
his eyes toward heaven, he seemed to feel a spirit
of prophetic inspiration. With his right hand upon the
head of the child, he reverently presumed to lift the curtain
which veils the future, fervently exclaiming,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Son of Abraham, scion of the tribe of Benjamin,
and heir of Benoni! The living blood of the Covenant
flows in thy veins! Thou shalt wax strong, and be
<pb n="6"/><anchor id="Pg006"/>learned in all that pertaineth to the Law! Thou shalt
be a tongue of the God of Jacob, and many shall tremble
when thou speakest! Thou shalt be a defender of Israel,
and bring judgment to the Gentiles! Thou shalt open
thy mouth and utter mighty things that are hidden from
the Greek and Roman! Thou shalt sorely vex the enemies
of the Circumcision, and bring them to naught!
With holy zeal shalt thou pursue them</q>—
</p>

<p>
Then his visage became fixed, and he was like one in
a trance. A voice, not his own, seemed to use his lips.
<q>I behold—judgment—defeat—darkness! <hi rend="italic">The uncircumcised
prevail!</hi></q>
</p>

<p>
Abdiel, the priest, trembled like an aspen, and upon
coming to himself, declared that he had seen a disturbing
vision.
</p>

<p>
The ancient Judaism accepted no compromise, and
bowed to no defeat. When surrounded, and even almost
submerged, by prevailing idolatry, polytheism, and
heathenism, like a bow temporarily bent, it at length
sprang back, and regained its original integrity. It was
a casting in rigid form of a conglomerate of truth and
error, righteousness and pride. It loathed other creeds
and philosophies, and its Deity was limited by a racial
boundary. It was a political theocracy.
</p>

<p>
Phariseeism, which was the leading element of Jewish
religiosity, was a compound of spiritual pride, exclusiveness,
and intolerance. Missionary effort among other
nations was not thought of because they were not worth
it. God was the God of Israel. The Chosen People felt
that they had a monopoly of the divine favor, and they
proposed to keep it. But the teaching of the ancient
<pb n="7"/><anchor id="Pg007"/>seers and expounders of righteousness, originally good,
had become incrusted with a superficial formalism, and
all vitality had left it. Even the Mosaic Law and the
later sublime poems and religious compositions, though
constantly and formally recited, were loaded down with
traditions, and had become a complex system of polished
dry bones. Notwithstanding the discipline of previous
dispersions and captivities, such was the spirit of the
Chosen People during the earliest years of the Christian
era.

<p>
The residence of Benoni was situated upon the more
elevated plateau which embraced the northwestern portion
of the Cilician metropolis. A little distance to the
north was the Orontes Gate, through which a thoroughfare,
paved with much-worn gray and white flags, led out
to the fertile regions in the broad plain above. Through
this portal surged a continuous stream of life, alternating
in direction during the different hours of the day like
the tides in an inlet from the sea. Here were donkeys,
with panniers bursting with fruits, lentils, onions, and
beans, and awkward camels, raw-boned, rough, and gray,
with great saddles hung over their backs, the capacious
folds of which contained seemingly endless resources
of baskets, boxes, and miscellaneous merchandise.
Horses, roughly harnessed to light wagons which were
heaped with dates, figs, grapes, and pomegranates, and
at intervals small flocks of sheep, calves, and other animals
for the food-supply of a great city, added to the
picturesque conglomerate of life and bustle. Here entered
blatant sellers of ducks, doves, and pigeons, mingling
their shrill cries with the general din and confusion.
The massive arched gateway formed the framework for
a shifting panorama of races, tribes, costumes, and
dia<pb n="9"/><anchor id="Pg009"/>lects. Interspersed in the throng were red and blue
cloaks more or less dingy, white turbans, faded tunics,
long beards, and bare legs. Oriental display and decoration
were seen in golden ornaments, including necklaces,
bracelets, and pendants, all lending a gleam and
sparkle to the motley streams of humanity. Here and
there were women of the common classes, wearing
loosely gathered long frocks, and upon their heads veils
or wimples ample enough to fall in graceful folds about
the shoulders. Some were leading brown-bodied and
half-naked children, with hair and features indexing the
blood of Greek, Jew, Cilician, or barbarian in picturesque
contrast.
</p>

<p>
Three broad streets converged at the Orontes Gate;
and these were lined with small shops containing merchandise,
fruits, skins filled with wines and other strong
drinks, jewelry, garments, articles for personal adornment,
unguents for anointing, besides amulets, charms,
and images in endless variety and abundance.
</p>

<p>
The dwelling of Benoni, though not far away, was
shut off from the noise and confusion by a high street-wall
in the rear, while in front the sloping grounds
extended directly to the wide, silvery Cydnus. There
were three broad terraces, with here and there clusters
of acacias, almonds, spice-trees, roses, oleander, and
jasmine between the winding paths. At intervals there
were rustic seats sheltered by bowers of flowering plants
and shrubs.
</p>

<p>
The house was two stories in height, substantial but
not pretentious, and built around a quadrangular court.
While not ornate, it was attractive and well
propor<pb n="10"/><anchor id="Pg010"/>tioned. The flat roof was surrounded by a low parapet,
and was furnished with a few wicker seats covered with
simple canopies. During the mild seasons the family
spent much time upon the roof, especially in the early
morning and evening hours.
</p>

<p>
The simple carvings and embellishments of the house
were Hebraic in design, and many of the utensils were
deeply suggestive of ancient symbolism and ritual. Extending
around the interior court was a cornice carved
in low relief, with designs depicting scenes from the
lives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the receiving of the
Law by Moses, the tabernacle, the ark of the covenant,
and representations of the Temple at Jerusalem, its
courts, and the seven golden candlesticks. In the atrium,
or principal apartment, stood an ancient cabinet, in which
was preserved with great care, in many wrappings, a
scroll of parchment, upon which was inscribed a record
of the direct genealogical line of descent from Abraham,
through the tribe of Benjamin, down to Benoni. The
very atmosphere of this house of <q>a Hebrew of the Hebrews</q>
was almost redolent with the odor of incense,
and its flavor was that of instituted feasts and festivals.
</p>

<p>
Tarsus, though advanced in sophistical logic and philosophy,
was in its leading characteristics morally depraved.
The seat of celebrated schools of letters, it
was, at the same time, the home of Eastern cults, whose
mad sensuality and weird superstition made up a pagan
corruption rarely equalled. A part of its idolatry consisted
of the very types and ideals of luxurious effeminacy,
gluttony, and sensuality. The iridescent film of
intellectual culture, which was drawn over the mass of
<pb n="11"/><anchor id="Pg011"/>moral degradation, gave it a charm and external refinement
which was more seductive than naked barbarism.
One of the chief festivals included the worship, with
elaborate rites, of statues of Sardanapalus and Semiramis,
upon the base or pedestal of which was engraved,—
</p>

<lg>
<l><q>EAT, DRINK, ENJOY THYSELF; THE REST IS NOTHING.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
To the Jews of the Dispersion who dwelt in Tarsus,
the spectacles of heathenism inspired in general a sense
of disgust. The very bigotry with which their economy
had become incrusted formed a kind of protection
against which a more plastic and characterless religion
would have measurably yielded. Under the intense
glare of the law such a paganism appeared in all its
abnormal deformity. The Jew was no sophist or sentimentalist;
and the Tarsian iniquity and abandon, far
from being attractive, strongly confirmed him in his own
traditions.
</p>

<p>
The prejudices of Phariseeism surrounded the very
cradle of the son of Benoni. Intolerance, fanaticism,
national pride, and exclusiveness built themselves deeply
into the organism of his childish nature. At the age of
five he had learned many passages from the sacred rolls
of parchment, and at six he could recite the <q>Shema</q>
and <q>Hallel.</q> At seven he was taken to his <q>vineyard,</q>
or school, which was attached to the synagogue;
and at ten he commenced the simpler doctrines of the
oral law which were collected in the <q>Mishna.</q>
</p>

<p>
Abdiel, the priest, often came to visit the family, and
was zealous touching the training of Saulus in ritual
and tradition. But though the vision of the triumph of
<pb n="12"/><anchor id="Pg012"/><q>the uncircumcised</q> had never been repeated, intervening
years had not entirely destroyed its portentous
impression, even though he had feigned to forget it.
Thirteen years had passed, and the son of Benoni had
been confirmed as a <q>Son of the Commandment.</q> He
was now prepared to go up to Jerusalem for the acquirement
of a deeper learning in one of the great schools
of the prophets where he might become a Rabbi.
</p>

<p>
Benoni also had two daughters, the elder of whom
had married long before, and removed from Tarsus.
Rebecca, the younger, was three years older than Saulus,
and was known among the Greeks of the neighborhood
as <q>the beautiful Jewess.</q> No brother and sister could
be more devotedly attached to each other; and their interests,
studies, and recreations were shared in common.
They were quite unlike in nature and disposition; but,
as is often the case, this seemed to strengthen their bond
of affection. Each supplied what was lacking in the
other. He was intense, impetuous, and unyielding, while
she was placid and rarely ruffled even under great provocation.
Though of recognized Jewish type in feature
and form, she was faultless even from the artistic standpoint
of the Greek. The artlessness and innocence which
from a pure soul also shone out through her personality
lent an additional charm. She usually appeared with
her jet-black hair gathered in two ample braids falling
gracefully behind, and interspersed near the ends with
golden threads, terminating in a small ornament with
pendants. A silken cap of light fabric and delicate
shading rested lightly upon her head, and around her
neck was a network of delicate chains intermingled with
<pb n="13"/><anchor id="Pg013"/>precious stones. The folds of her white loose-fitting
robe were gathered by a braided scarlet girdle, ornamented
with delicate pendants of pearl; and her neck
and arms were but lightly covered by a gauze scarf, upon
which was a scattered embroidery of golden thread.
Every detail of personality and costume indicated a refinement
which was genuine and graceful.
</p>

<p>
At the close of one sultry August day, the family were
seated in their usual cosey corner upon the house-top, as
was their wont in warm weather. The fierce Cilician
sun was just sinking behind the great brown Taurus
mountains in the western horizon. The furnace-like air
of the great shimmering plain to the north and west,
which had been wavy with heat, was reluctantly yielding
to a more endurable temperature, and the lengthening
shadows gradually softened the glare of the broad landscape
which stretched away beyond the city to the great
mountain wall in the distant haze. The silvery current
of the Cydnus, with its foliage-lined banks, could be followed
by the eye, winding its zigzag way, and narrowing
in the dim distance almost to a thread when traced
toward its native mountain hiding-place. The purple
light, which lingered about the summits of the far-away
range, had a weird and foreboding look; and the great
chasm in the Taurus, into which the orb of day had
plunged, glowed with an unwonted and sullen obstinacy
as it slowly yielded to the darkening shadows. A few
heavy clouds which hung over the highest peaks were
lined with a crimson glory, which, while gorgeous, seemed
restless and fateful.
</p>

<p>
If Nature was in a serious and contemplative mood,
<pb n="14"/><anchor id="Pg014"/>the family of Benoni was not less absorbed in revery.
Silence long prevailed. All were gazing, not so much
at the white roofs and gilded domes beyond the Cydnus,
toward which they faced, nor upon the garden in the immediate
foreground, as into the vista of the future. Eyes
were looking out, but thoughts were turned within.
</p>

<p>
What of the morrow? What of the far-reaching consequences
of the movement just to begin? Kaleidoscopic
visions of coming days flitted through their minds.
Stillness prevailed over the city. The very atmosphere
was stagnant. The household of Benoni seemed to have
a prophetic foregleam of great events, but their character
and detail were hidden in the impenetrable mists
of the future.
</p>

<p>
Saulus was seated beside his mother, with her arm
encircling him, and her hand gently stroking his cheek.
To-morrow they were to part. Rebecca was the first to
break the silence. She drew herself to the other side
of her brother, and taking his hand in her own, gave
him a warm kiss upon his cheek.
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother, dear! How can we give thee up? Our
hearts fail us when we think of thy journey which begins
with to-morrow’s sun.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will be
with thee, my son,</q> said the mother. <q>And thou wilt
see the great Rabban Gamaliel,<note place="foot">There were only seven of the Rabbis to whom the Jews gave the title
of Rabban; and three of these were Gamaliels of this family, who each in
turn rose to the high distinction of <foreign rend="italic">Nasî</foreign>, or President of the School.</note> and be taught of him.
Thou wilt bring honor upon the house of Benoni, O my
Saulus!</q>
</p>

<pb n="15"/><anchor id="Pg015"/>

<p>
She folded him in closer embrace, and stroking back
his curly locks, pressed repeated kisses upon his forehead.
</p>

<p>
<q>O my mother! no one will ever love me as thou
dost. My life hath been thine, but I must now give it to
the God of Israel—to the Chosen People. I will grow
to be a leader, and help to gather them from their dispersion.
I will bring to naught the counsel of the Gentiles.
Thou art yielding me to the service of our people,
and in due time I will render a worthy account of my
doings. O my mother! I will learn wisdom of the great
Rabban, and be a true son of the covenant.</q>
</p>

<p>
The father aroused himself from his revery and drew
nearer.
</p>

<p>
<q>Son, thou hast my blessing. Thy words proclaim
thy zeal for the Law. Thou wilt surely prevail! Hast
thou everything prepared for the journey? The ship
will set sail to-morrow at the third hour.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My good mother hath helped me to make all things
ready.</q>
</p>

<p>
Benoni was to go up to the Holy City with his son.
</p>

<p>
<q>Would there were a ship for Cæsarea that knows the
God of Israel!</q> said the father.
</p>

<p>
<q>In what ship <hi rend="italic">do</hi> we set sail?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My son, it is a Phœnician vessel, which is dedicated
to the gods of Tyre, and it carries the sign of Castor and
Pollux.</q>
</p>

<p>
The mother raised her head inquiringly. <q>Is there not
peril from pirates?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay; the Romans have cleared the seas of them.</q>
</p>

<p>
Again a long pause, and even the impulsive Saulus
<pb n="16"/><anchor id="Pg016"/>was sad and thoughtful. Noticing that his mother had
buried her face in her hands, he gently drew them aside
and gave her another kiss.
</p>

<p>
<q>O my mother! dry thy tears. The days will pass
speedily when I may return from the Holy City. My
love for thee shall never wane.</q>
</p>

<p>
The shades of evening had gathered, and anon the clear
full moon appeared above the horizon, flooding the broad
expanse of white roofs with a pale, misty light. The Cydnus
hurried quietly past, gleaming like a stream of molten
silver. By a general impulse the little group awakened
from their quietude.
</p>

<p>
Saulus turned toward his sister.
</p>

<p>
<q>The river is serene. Get thy lute, and let us take the
shallop, that I may feel the oars once more before my
departure.</q>
</p>

<p>
Hand in hand the two darted down the stone stairway,
and after a hasty change of outer costume, made their way
down one of the well-worn paths to the river’s bank.
Unlocking the little boat-house, Saulus pushed the light
shallop to the landing, and the two stepped in for an
excursion. The young Israelite grasped the oars with
his usual alacrity; and the scions of the house of Benoni
glided out upon the stream and quickly disappeared, making
their way against the broad current of the Cydnus.

<q>By Pallas! A bird hath flown into our net. The

<q>A riddle for my interpretation, Marcius?</q>

<q>Well, my gay Leander, the slaves down-stairs say

</p>

<p>
<q>Thou sayest well. The sun warms and the breeze

</p>

<p>
The Roman smiled, and his dark eyes sparkled from
beneath their heavy brows.
</p>

<p>
<q>A much-needed addition to our coterie, Marcius. The
gods are propitious to-night.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thy discrimination is fine, my genial Greek. Variety
is fitting.</q>
</p>

<p>

<p>
<q>Even the elements bespeak a welcome with their noisy
commotion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A truce to thy poetic fancies, my gallant. They say
the bird hath an incumbrance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A lover in her train, sayest thou?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay; a small brother.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Did the skies drop them down with the hail-stones
in the storm that just passed over, Marcius?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I cannot swear to it, my Leander; but it seemeth
likely, for the slaves say that they appeared just afterwards
at the gate which opens toward the Cydnus.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O thou prosaic Roman! It is the gods who are prodigal
with their favors.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Be it so. Who recks the wind, where it blows, so
that it ministers to our fancies. Thou art an ardent
votary of thy favorite divinities; but miracles like this
are not common.</q>
</p>

<p>

<q>Son of the Muses! Descend from thy flight among

shallop being disabled, they made a very unexpected but

walls.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The shades of Daphne be praised, Marcius; but what
of the lad in attendance?</q>
</p>

<pb n="19"/><anchor id="Pg019"/>

<p>
<q>If we find no service for him within the palace, we
may have to offer him to the gods as a Hebrew sacrifice,
or, in other words, present him as a graceful tribute to
the waters of the Cydnus.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou sayest well. The Styx is often a shady but
poetic necessity. The gods give their favorites early
release.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A happy turn to a shadowy sentiment, my gay Leander,
and quite worthy of thy ever-presiding Muse.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But will not our guest feel neglected at this delay
in her reception, Marcius?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay, my gallant; she must be made presentable.
The slave woman, Chloe, informs me that she was terribly
dishevelled from the storm, but that her beauty is
marvellous. She is being warmed and refreshed.</q>
</p>

of Grecian lore.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Be it so. But a truce to the lore of the past. Let
us now to the present. Pour a libation to Venus, and
bring a vessel of the wine of Lesbos, and we will drink
to the health of the fair one—the last to come under our
gracious protection.</q>
</p>

<pb n="20"/><anchor id="Pg020"/>

<p>
<q>Thou sayest well, Marcius. What the immortal gods
send, let us receive with thanks, and let it be consecrated
in the charmed halls of our temple of Eros.</q>
</p>

<p>
The two seated themselves, and in a little time each
had drained a large amphora of wine—once repeated.
Soon the blood shot like flashes of fire through their
veins. At length Leander arose, and took from a vase a
handful of rare flowers.
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">I weave a chaplet for my Jewish maiden, and chant
once more in her honor:—</q>
</p>

<lg>
<l>‘We are fallen, but not forlorn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If something is left to cherish;</l>
<l>As Love was the earliest born,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre: none">So Love is the last to perish.’</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
With the continued draughts of wine, the Greek and
the Roman grew more talkative and noisy.
</p>

<p>
<q>By Bacchus! Leander, did my ears deceive me?
Didst thou say <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Jewish maiden before thy song?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Gently, impetuous Roman. I drank to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Jewish
maiden.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We shall <hi rend="italic">see</hi>, O thou effeminate Greek!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> see, then, perfidious Roman!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ha! rash dolt! We will have no Brutus here.
Slaves! Chloe! Bring up my guest and introduce
her.</q>
</p>

<p>
At the same moment he dealt the Greek a powerful
blow, which caused him to measure his length on the
bear-skin rugs that were spread upon the polished, inlaid
floor. Then, clapping his hands for a slave to assist
him, they bore the prostrate Leander into an adjoining
<pb n="21"/><anchor id="Pg021"/>chamber, and deposited him upon a couch. Marcius
then returned to receive the latest guest.
</p>

<p>
While the episode just narrated had been going on,
there had come floating in from a distance the tones of
unseen minstrelsy—now swelling, now diminishing—in
a way to hold the soul spellbound. This was an accompaniment
to the nightly revelry and orgies.
</p>

<p>
Adjoining the apartment where the comrades had held
converse, and separated from it by heavy draperies, was
a large banquet-room, and still beyond, the room from
whence came the strains of music. Mingled with the
melody and with the measured rhythm of the dance,
there escaped fragments of hilarity, merrymaking, and
the echo of voices in pleasing confusion.
</p>

<p>
All the apartments and their accessories were eloquent
with a voluptuous refinement. Culture, wealth, and
depravity seemed here to form a close combination.
The occupants evidently were of patrician blood, corrupted
by luxury and sensuality, while the pictures,
statuary, symbols, and images indicated that their oft-invoked
divinities were as cruel and degenerate as
themselves. The whole interior of the palace was an
intricate but beautiful maze, arranged to confuse and
captivate the senses. It was one of those highly organized
efforts, in a luxurious and depraved age, in a
heathen metropolis, to storm the citadels of supposed
pleasure, and to compel the inverted mechanism of Nature
herself to yield without reserve the last charm that
is contained in her storehouse. Art, nature, the flowers,
the stars, rhythm, melody, beauty, and feeling, with
cruelty and brutality interwoven—everything was placed
<pb n="22"/><anchor id="Pg022"/>under contribution in the mad and exhaustive search for
a perfect sentient paradise. It was an age when the
senses and instincts of mankind seemed to reach a
climax of abnormity, while outwardly gilded with artistic
charm and gracefulness. It was an era of intellectual
delusion and spiritual insanity. Man must crowd and
surfeit his baser nature to the bursting-point to-day, for
to-morrow he is not.
</p>

<p>
The palace was brilliant with numberless lights; and
the warm air was heavy with the odors of myrrh, violets,
jasmine, and other flowers and spices. Fountains cast
up a delicate spray which glittered like star-dust in their
pulsating prismatic play. Mirrors of polished steel duplicated
every beautiful object, dazzled the bewildered
senses, and flung chaplets of rosy chains around the soul
of every captive and victim. To breathe the magic air
was to experience a delicious intoxication.
</p>

<p>
The vaulted ceilings of the principal apartments were
frescoed with a sky in which were floating fleecy clouds
of rosy hue, from the midst of which smiled faces of
bewildering shape and beauty.
</p>

<p>
In the dances and religious processions that were
painted upon panels trooped forms of the divinest
beauty, bearing garlands and chaplets and lyres, keeping
time to the soft minstrelsy of melody which seemed
to issue from the very walls. Every ornament, picture,
and statue silently chanted an invitation to <hi rend="small">ENJOY</hi>.
</p>

<p>
The door from below opened, and Chloe ushered the
pure Jewish maiden into the presence of Marcius. But
she came not alone. The small brother, though uninvited,
appeared also, and they were hand in hand.

<p>
Saulus plied the oars with a steady stroke that would
have done credit to more mature muscles, and the light
shallop with its precious freight glided rapidly over the
mirror-like surface of the Cydnus. The air was laden
with fragrant exhalations from spicy shrubs, the bending
branches of which hung over the water on either bank;
the grounds immediately upon the river being generally
laid out in gardens, which, like those of Benoni, extended
to the water’s edge. The lily and rose-tree, the oleander
and mulberry, each made its contribution of sweet odors,
while their misty shadows quivered upon the surface of
the water as the two moved gently by. Out of the thick
foliage, here and there, came the song of a nightingale,
the soft whistle of a quail, or the cooing of a turtle-dove
calling its mate, perchance disturbed by the plash of the
oars.
</p>

<p>
The poetic inspiration and openness to nature’s voices,
so prominent during the former days of Jewish psalmody
and prophecy, had greatly decayed under the influence
of a harsh formalism. The children of Benoni, while
not indifferent to the beauty about them, were rather
dwelling amid vague visions of the future.
</p>

<p>
The full moon was now almost overhead. The
even<pb n="24"/><anchor id="Pg024"/>ing air, while calm, had a preternatural closeness and
intensity. A portentous pause prevailed—a lingering as
if on the brink of fateful destiny. Nature seemed prophetically
to be holding her breath. But the reveries
of the scions of Benoni were not disturbed by portentous
signs. Nothing so motionless could cause them
to forget the riches of ancient Hebrew lore, or obscure
the bright plans in the near future for Saulus. As each
was wrapped in meditation, some time passed without a
word being spoken. But at length strains of music in
the far distance came floating over the water, and Saulus
was aroused by their suggestiveness.
</p>

<p>
<q>Attune thy lute, my sister, and sing one of the songs
of Israel. If thou wilt, let it be the song of Miriam.</q>
</p>

<p>
Rebecca took up her favorite instrument, and soon the
echoes of her pure voice with its dulcet accompaniment
floated out over the waves.
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="post: none">‘Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously;</q></l>
<l><q rend="pre: none">The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.’</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Other songs and chants of the Chosen People followed;
and then the Holy City, the Temple, and its services
formed the theme of converse.
</p>

<p>
The time had flown swiftly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Peace be with thee, my brother! Have we not come
far? Let us turn homeward.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The evening is well spent; but the Cydnus is serene,
and the current favors our return.</q>
</p>

<p>
The shallop was quickly put about, and Saulus grasped
the oars for a steady pull; but, as they turned their gaze
<pb n="25"/><anchor id="Pg025"/>down the river, the white roofs and towers of the city
were hidden by a great black curtain.
</p>

<p>
<q>O my Rebecca! a tempest is at hand!</q>
</p>

<p>
Saulus bent to the oars with an energy born of desperation.
Soon a blinding flash of lightning illumined the
broad expanse, followed by a heavy peal of thunder.
</p>

<p>
<q>The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob will be
with and keep us, my brother. <q>Behold, he that keepeth
Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
The storm came on apace. The density of the darkness
was intensified by the lightning-flashes which like
great darting serpents thrust themselves athwart the sky.
The fierce roar of the wind was now mingled with the
thunder; and although Saulus struggled heroically to
keep the sharp prow to the wind, the little craft was
borne uncontrollably along, barely being kept upright.
</p>

<p>
<q>O God of our fathers! Thou who didst bring Israel
through the Red Sea, save us, or we perish!</q> exclaimed
Rebecca.
</p>

<p>
They were swept along; and when the boat was just
about to fill, it was dashed violently upon the shore.
The momentum which crushed their frail bark as it
struck landed them suddenly upon the ground.
</p>

<p>
The children of Benoni were saved. Partially stunned,
but otherwise unharmed, they arose, and in each other’s
embrace looked up, and thanked the God of Israel for
deliverance. Turning to explore their landing-place,
they found themselves in the yard of a large house or
palace, which was brilliantly lighted, and from which
issued the confused noise of voices, mingled with music
and laughter.
</p>

<pb n="26"/><anchor id="Pg026"/>

<p>
<q>We have fallen among the Gentiles,</q> said Saulus.
</p>

<p>
On either side of the yard was a high wall, and nothing
remained but to knock at the Cydnus gate of the
palace for admission and relief. They were kindly received
in the basement by the slaves in attendance, who
took them in, and administered warmth and refreshment.
</p>

<p>
At length Chloe, the head female slave, who had informed
Marcius of their sad plight, received a message
from him. She turned to Rebecca.
</p>

<p>
<q>O my fair Jewess! Marcius, the master, craves an
audience with thee in the hall above.</q>
</p>

<p>
Chloe then conducted her up-stairs into the presence
of the Roman, and Saulus followed unbidden.
</p>

<p>
Marcius advanced with a gracious bow, taking no
notice of the boy.
</p>

<p>
<q>Methinks thou art an unexpected, but very welcome
guest.</q>
</p>

<p>
Rebecca gave no answer, but drew back with a shudder.
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Come, my fair one! It becometh us to dispense
with formality. Thou hast escaped the waves, and we
give thee shelter and protection. Welcome to these fair
halls. As the poet hath sung:—</q>
</p>

<lg>
<l>‘And no god on heaven or earth—</l>
<l>Not the Paphian Queen of Mirth,</l>
<l>Nor the vivid Lord of Light,</l>
<l>Nor the triple Maid of Night,</l>
<l>Nor the Thunderer’s self, shall be</l>
<l><q rend="pre: none">Blest and honor’d more than thee!’</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
<q>O thou noble Roman!</q> said the Hebrew lad, opening
his eyes wide upon Marcius. <q>We thank thee for
<pb n="27"/><anchor id="Pg027"/>thy hospitality to the children of Benoni; and now we
will depart. Peace be with thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My young son of Israel! The tempest still rages
without. The night is chill and boisterous for thy fair
sister.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We mind not the storm, and the God of our fathers
will be with us. I pray thee, let us depart in peace.</q>
</p>

<p>
The Roman deigned no reply.
</p>

<p>
The color came and went in the face of the young
Jew; for though but a youth, he penetrated the smooth
mask of the Roman, and divined his treachery and
cruelty.
</p>

<p>
Marcius again addressed himself to Rebecca.
</p>

<p>
<q>My fair Jewess! Thou shouldst thank the gods—or
thy Hebrew Jehovah—for thy deliverance from the
cold embrace of the Cydnus. We offer thee warmth and
music and poetry and wine, and—be it so—love, whose
cup we may gently quaff.</q>
</p>

<p>
Rebecca cast a beseeching look.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Roman citizen of Tarsus! I pray thee bid us to
depart. We fear not the storm. The hearts of our
father and mother will be made glad by our return.
The Romans have honor! We will now go in peace.</q>
</p>

<p>
A sullen frown was the only reply.
</p>

<p>
With compressed lip and fiery blood coursing through
every vein, Saulus bent his gaze upon the Roman, but
was silent from the very intensity of his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Marcius, heated by the wine which he had drunk with
Leander, gradually became more harsh and pitiless.
</p>

<p>
<q>Doth the beautiful Jewess scorn the devotion of a
patrician? Ah! The divinity of the son of Aphrodite
<pb n="28"/><anchor id="Pg028"/>is supreme! The Jewish life is poor and barren! The
Roman is rich, and offers thee jewels and banquets, and
slaves for thy service. Away with thine indifference,
and join the revelry with me in yonder banquet-hall.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou base and brutal Roman!</q> cried Saulus. <q>Thou
uncircumcised heathen and idolater! The God of Abraham
and Isaac and Jacob will smite thee, and deliver
us out of thy hand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hebrew stripling of the house of Benoni! Thy
tongue is sharp! Start not! I only ask thy sister in
marriage. Think of an alliance with patrician blood!
Remain in the palace with slaves to do thy bidding!
We will train thee in all the graces of Greek and Roman
art, poetry, and music.</q>
</p>

<p>
Seeing at a glance that he had made no impression,
he resumed in a sarcastic tone,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Thy body and that of the fair one will be vainly
sought, far below, amid the drift-wood that will be thrown
upon the shore by the swollen Cydnus. In such a tempest,
all trace of the children of Benoni will be lost, <hi rend="italic">lost</hi>,
rash boy!</q>
</p>

<p>
Again assuming a blandness which but illy concealed
the fierce passions which were burning behind it, he
continued,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Foolish captives! To the knowledge of your tribe,
the Jewess and her small brother have been swallowed
up by the tempest, and so they will remain! Be it so.
But I promise, if ye be willing captives, every luxury
shall be heaped upon you. Consider well! The Roman
builds his palace with massive walls.</q>
</p>

<p>
The children of Benoni read their fate as in an open
<pb n="29"/><anchor id="Pg029"/>book. A Tarsian house of iniquity had closed around
them. As they glanced about, every statue and picture
and idol seemed to mock them, and every mirror duplicated
the mockery. O cruel fate! Bare, jagged prison-walls
would have seemed more hospitable!
</p>

<p>
Did this strange hour belong to the same evening in
which they had started for a joyous moonlight excursion
on the Cydnus? Where were all the happy dreams of
three short hours ago? Where were now the bright pictures
of the Holy City, the Temple, and the school of
the great Rabban? Were <hi rend="italic">they</hi> not the reality and this
a mere hideous dream?
</p>

<p>
But for the heat of the wine, it seemed as though Marcius
must have quailed before the pure indignation of
the Hebrew children.
</p>

<p>
The tempest still raged without.
</p>

<p>
Saulus held his sister tightly by the hand; and though
but a lad in stature, he stood firmly erect, and his eyes
shot defiant glances at Marcius. Stirred to the depths
of his young soul by the baseness of the Roman, he
seemed to live through years of experience in a short
hour.
</p>

<p>
Marcius seated himself, and with an impatient scowl
waited for their submission. He could afford to give a
little time, because there could be but one possible outcome.
But, though master of the palace, with all to do
his will, he glanced uneasily about, as if the walls might
have ears. He looked into the next room where Leander,
though but partially stunned by his blow, was lying in a
stupor of intoxication. He then resumed his seat, and
again turned towards Rebecca.
</p>

<pb n="30"/><anchor id="Pg030"/>

<p>
<q>My sweet caged bird, why ruffle thy plumage more?
Give thy Roman lord some gracious favor, and thou shalt
want for nothing. The tempest which rages without,
and also that slight commotion which disturbs thine own
mind, will soon be stilled and forgotten.</q>
</p>

<p>
Rebecca covered her face with her hands, while Saulus
exclaimed with a strong gesture,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Jehovah will deliver his children! We are his
chosen people!</q>
</p>

<p>
Then, looking upward, he cried,—
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend="italic">We await thy salvation!</hi></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By Bacchus! Who is the God of Israel? But, my
impetuous infant, I will proceed with order and dignity.
Willing or unwilling captives? Ha! Now for a final,
sagacious answer before the sand runs through this small
glass.</q><note place="foot">A ten-minute hour-glass.</note>
</p>

<p>
The moments slipped away, and only the roar outside
broke the stillness.
</p>

<p>
The surging of human passion, the constancy of affection,
the happiness and misery of common life, the
epochs of trial and triumph, and the mystery of fate, all
span the wide chasms of time and space. Human life is
one. Its outward circumstances may be never so varied,
but within there is a universal correspondence. Through
some shape, in the evolution of character, the same battles
must be fought and the same victories won. Customs,
races, languages, and governments come and go; but
love, hate, friendship, passion, vice, and virtue remain.
The Present is only the Past with a new countenance.
</p>

<p>
The Hebrew maiden and her young brother remained
<pb n="31"/><anchor id="Pg031"/>firmly unconquerable. They even became calm and
confident with assurance. They had an unmistakable
vision of deliverance, and felt that it was at hand. Its
form or manner they could not divine. There is an
intrinsic faculty which awakens in some souls, and takes
hold upon the future. It feels coming events as though
they were already present. That it is not commonly
developed by no means proves its non-existence. It
deals with great crises or turning-points, rather than
their details.
</p>

<p>
Marcius sat watching the tiny stream of sand as it
passed through the small orifice. The last grain had
fallen.
</p>

<p>
<q>Captives! willing or unwilling?</q>
</p>

<p>
The answer came from an unexpected quarter. A
flash of forked lightning illumined the palace, and rent it
from roof to foundation. Marcius was prostrated and
lay as one dead. The Hebrew children, though stunned
and momentarily unconscious, soon aroused themselves.
There was a panic in the palace, and a hurrying to and
fro of all who had escaped unharmed. A part of the
slaves, thinking the building was about to fall, unbarred
the front portal and hurried into the street. Saulus and
Rebecca, hand in hand, fled down the broad stairway,
where they met Chloe, who was hastily gathering up a
few valuables before making her escape.
</p>

<p>
<q>The gods demanded your release,</q> said she; and
guiding them through an intricate passage-way to the
front portal, they soon found themselves in the street.

<p>
The great Temple which crowned the summit of Mount
Moriah in the Holy City formed the visible pivotal
centre of Judaism, and was the pride and joy of every
son and daughter of Israel. It was surrounded by a
broad porch, which extended entirely around its four
sides, forming a most imposing feature and approach.
Immediately within was the great court of the Gentiles,
which enclosed the more exclusive courts and the Temple
proper. Then came the court of the Women, and
next beyond, and extending on three sides around the
court of the Priests and inner Temple, was the court of
Israel. Here was located the session-room of the Sanhedrin;
and near by, or adjoining, was the great lecture-room
of Gamaliel. This eminent Rabban of <q>the school
of Hillel</q> was held in great respect for his wisdom; and
<pb n="33"/><anchor id="Pg033"/>the most promising youth of the tribes, far and near,
gathered to become his pupils. While a legal Israelite
and nominal Pharisee, he was tolerant, and permitted
great liberty in discussion. His students, being from
many different provinces, embraced among their number
not only Pharisees and Sadducees of different grades, but
also many adherents of other sects and philosophies.
Some of the Essenes, Gnostics, and those of Hellenistic
and Aramaic opinion of various shades, including even
Cyrenians and Alexandrians, sent their sons to this
famous Hebrew university. Many of its students were
quite familiar with Greek literature and philosophy.
The widespread reputation of Gamaliel, and the liberty
of private opinion which he permitted, gave his school a
broad and cosmopolitan character, as contrasted with the
smaller Rabbinical schools, which often simply taught
the letter of the Jewish law. It was an <q>Assembly of
the Wise,</q> where a degree of freedom was enjoyed which
was probably unparalleled in its era.
</p>

<p>
Gamaliel occupied a high seat or tribune in his assembly-room,
while his students were grouped around
and below him, literally <q>at his feet.</q> At stated times
there were dialectical discussions, when he was more
their moderator than teacher.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps some text of Old Testament Scripture would
be taken for the subject of commentary. Various interpretations
were then given; a comparison with other
religions instituted, aphorisms defined, different writers
compared, allegories translated, and opinions and authorities
quoted and discussed. The pupils were encouraged
to criticise each other, and to question the Rabban, and
divergent views were expressed and invited.
</p>

<pb n="34"/><anchor id="Pg034"/>

<p>
According to the Talmud, the remarkable body of
Rabbinical jurisprudence could well be compared to the
Roman body of civil law, or even with English common
law, in the vast accumulation of precedents, arguments,
and opinions. It included not merely Jewish theology,
but the whole civil code and practice. From the best
accounts, this Hebrew university bore some resemblance
to the discussions of Plato in the Academy, or the lectures
of Aristotle in the Lyceum. The students received
an excellent training in dialectics; and many became not
only good logicians, but capable of felicitous literary
style and poetic expression.
</p>

<p>
In the university there were incipient sects, parties,
and factions of various shades, often with their recognized
leaders or exponents. The great Rabban, within
reasonable limits, encouraged the spirit of free thought
and inquiry.
</p>

<p>
Saulus, being of ardent temperament, soon became not
only an eager and untiring student, but an intense partisan.
He rapidly became noted for his powerful invective
towards his opponents, and even though but a boy,
was so jealous of the traditions of the fathers that many
times he was involved in disputes and quarrels. Intellectually
acute and with retentive memory, his mind
was well stored with <q>hard sentences of old,</q> and confirmatory
quotations from the Scriptures were always at
his command. Moreover, he gradually became belligerent,
and was ready to fight for his opinions. Instead of
being softened or modified by the variety of elements
which surrounded him, he grew more aggressive. His
intemperate zeal led him towards intolerance and even
<pb n="35"/><anchor id="Pg035"/>persecution, so far as his position rendered it possible.
As a strict literalist, he soon persuaded himself that
those who were careless of the letter of the law were
accursed of God, and therefore not deserving of much
mercy at the hands of man.
</p>

<p>
The khan, or inn, where Saulus and a few other ultra
Pharisees lived, was a headquarters for zealous literalists,
and fronted upon a square known as the Sheepmarket,
which was a little to the north of Mount Moriah, and but
a short distance from the Tower of Antonia. It was but
a few minutes’ walk from the Sheepgate, which was one
of the portals in the city wall which led eastward through
the Valley of Jehosaphat to Gethsemane and the Mount
of Olives beyond.
</p>

<p>
Among the pupils of Gamaliel was one, Victor Serenus
by name, who had become the recognized leader of an
important following in the assembly. Although three
years older than Saulus, they were members of the
same class. He was a native of Alexandria, Egypt, and
his parents were liberal Jewish Hellenists. He was
rather tall, well-proportioned, of blond complexion, and
had a mass of wavy chestnut hair, which crowned a face
and head of ideal form and expression. The sparkle
and clearness of his dark blue eyes indexed a delicate
soul and noble nature. A marked repose and lofty
bearing, combined with brightness and optimism in his
demeanor, formed a combination as rare as it was attractive.
An inward purity and strength of soul seemed
tangibly to shine out through his physical organism.
He had early possessed the advantages of the best intellectual
culture of his native city, and was an intimate
<pb n="36"/><anchor id="Pg036"/>friend and associate of Philo, who then was just beginning
to lay the foundation for the world-wide reputation
which he afterwards gained as an eminent writer and
philosopher. Though not a member of any Jewish sect,
he was familiar with the doctrines of the Gnostics,
Essenes, Therapeutæ, and other systems of the Jewish
dispersion. Belonging definitely to no one of them, he
seemed to have absorbed a large measure of the truth
contained in all, leaving behind their limitations and
exclusiveness. Soon after coming to the Holy City to
supplement an education already of unusual quality, he
gradually became the recognized leader of the broadest
and most liberal element of the assembly. This came
about not from any aggressiveness, but from innate
quality and character, the power of which could not be
hidden.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Saulus, from inherent brilliancy
and great force of character, became the recognized
champion of the dogmatists and literalists. It naturally
happened, that, in the free discussions which were permitted
by Rabban Gamaliel, Serenus and Saulus found
themselves at the head of opposing factions.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p>
The seasons flew rapidly by, and the fourth year of
Saulus’s life in the Holy City was drawing to a close.
Although still small in stature, his growth in mental
acquirement and intensity since he had entered the
school of Gamaliel had been remarkable. His rather
insignificant physical appearance had considerable compensation
in an executive talent and power which easily
marked him as a born leader of men. With plain and
<pb n="37"/><anchor id="Pg037"/>unattractive features of the pronounced Jewish type, and
a mixture of pale and red in his complexion, he was
outwardly commonplace; but when enlisted in disputation
a quick flush would pass over his countenance,
and, with changed expression, the commanding dignity
and fire of his bearing would astonish all beholders.
Loyal to his convictions and faithful to his friends, he
was at the same time intolerant, impetuous, and terrible
toward all whom he regarded as opposers of the strictest
Jewish economy. His violent temper made itself felt
in his orations and debates, and already had involved
him in several tumults and perils. After receiving repeated
warnings from Rabban Gamaliel, he had barely
escaped formal condemnation and dismissal. Tendencies
had already developed and antagonisms been
definitely formed that were destined to play an important
part in coming time.
</p>

<p>
Since the brief and tempestuous reign of Archelaus,
the son and successor of Herod the Great, the Roman
Emperor, Cæsar Augustus, in order to humiliate the
Holy City, had removed the seat of the Judean government
to Cæsarea, Jerusalem thereby becoming a secondary
provincial city. During this period the high priest,
Annas, who was thoroughly the creature of the Roman
dominion, kept up the semblance of a court in the Herodian
palace on Mount Zion. Every considerable Judean
town and city was garrisoned with Roman soldiers. The
Tower of Antonia was held by a strong force, and Roman
guards kept every gate of the city and palace. Merciless
taxation and exaction kept the Jews in abject subjugation.
Having lost every vestige of political independence, they
<pb n="38"/><anchor id="Pg038"/>now devoted themselves more closely than ever before to
the complicated ceremonialism of their national religion.
</p>

<p>
Just adjoining and opening out of Gamaliel’s main
auditorium was a commodious hall, known as the
Lyceum, which was used for the informal disputations
of the pupils of the assembly. Here at stated times
were discussed various questions of philosophy, law,
theology, and especially the doctrines and interpretation
of the Jewish Scriptures. On these occasions, which
were quite distinct from the regular and official exercises
of the assembly, some one of the students often presided,
and the sessions were open to the public of all
classes. Here were often gathered Jews of high and low
degree, scribes, Pharisees, Sadducees, and publicans,
both from the city and provinces, with a sprinkling of
Greeks and Romans; so that not infrequently there were
seen mingled in the mass the broad phylactery of a
Rabbi, the gorgeous costume of a centurion, or the gilded
helmet of a soldier of the garrison. The Holy City was
full of factions, some of which were bigoted, fanatical,
and even bloodthirsty; and often representatives of these
classes would be found in the Lyceum, drawn thither by
the warmth and excitement of the disputations. Nothing
less than the iron grip of Rome could keep all these
pent-up elements in outward order and subjection; but,
in spite of all repression, outbreaks and persecutions
were frequent.
</p>

<p>
Slightly raised and back of the tribune from which the
speakers made their arguments was a gallery reserved
for women, who were freely admitted to these informal
debates.
</p>

<pb n="39"/><anchor id="Pg039"/>

<p>
The Roman rule, though politically tyrannous, was
entirely tolerant, as to all questions of philosophy and
religion, so long as its own political control was not disturbed.
It did not trouble itself about the institutes
of Moses, the Psalms of David, the messages of the
prophets, the speculations of Greek philosophy, or the
doctrines of the scribes and Pharisees, so long as Cæsar’s
mandates were unquestioned and his tribute willingly
rendered.

<epigraph><lg>
<l><q>Whom the gods destroy they first make mad.</q></l>
</lg></epigraph>

<p>
<q>God is a jealous God, and he will not be the God of
the heathen until they submit and bow to him as the God
of Israel! They are accursed!</q>
</p>

<p>
It was the voice of Saulus; and his words, uttered in
vehement tones, rang through the Lyceum. His countenance
was flushed, hands tightly clinched, and his gestures
violent.
</p>

<p>
A tumult of applause followed from the ultra-Pharisaical
party, who were all partisans of Saulus.
</p>

<p>
The hall was thronged with a motley crowd from the
streets, including people of all degrees, as well as the
pupils of Gamaliel. The disputation was one of unwonted
fervor, so that several were finally drawn into it
who had come in only as lookers-on. The Rabban was
not present; and, as the controversy became heated, the
young student who was presiding found it impossible to
preserve any semblance of order.
</p>

<p>
Victor Serenus arose to answer the argument of Saulus,
who had ended a long harangue for Jewish exclusiveness
with the words above given. His commanding presence,
serene bearing, and perfect self-command caused a
sud<pb n="41"/><anchor id="Pg041"/>den hush. With dignified mien and a graceful wave of
the hand he commenced his argument.
</p>

<p>
<q>I bring you peace, but I must judge righteously. I
also am a Jew of the Dispersion, but must call in question
the conclusion of the matter as given by my friend
Saulus. As a native of Alexandria, a friend of Philo,
and a disciple of the eminent and tolerant Rabban, my
voice is for spiritual freedom. To-day, O fellow-members
of the Assembly! I openly wash my hands of the
<q>mint, anise, and cummin</q> of the sect of the Pharisees.
I hesitate no longer to boldly affirm the truth which I
have long felt stirring within me. The traditions taught
by the scribes and elders have become burdens upon
men’s shoulders too grievous to be longer borne. God
is God over all, and no respecter of persons. He is not
merely a tribal Deity, local and Jewish, but the Father
of all nations and peoples to the ends of the earth.</q>
</p>

<p>
The liberal faction, including a few Greeks and
Romans who were scattered among the throng, signified
their approval, while the adherents of Saulus cried out
with fierce exclamations of condemnation.
</p>

<p>
A little apart from the common seats, in the gallery
of the women, was a place especially reserved for the
wives and daughters of the Rabban and his friends.
Here was seated a young girl who was an interested observer
of the disputation. As we shall have somewhat
to do with her in the future, a brief introduction is not
amiss. Her features, which were mildly of the Jewish
type, were very regular and beautiful, and her bearing
and expression bore evidence of grace and refinement.
Her form was of medium size, willowy and symmetrical;
<pb n="42"/><anchor id="Pg042"/>and from under rather prominent brows and lashes shone
out large soft dark eyes, radiantly expressive and ingenuous.
She was in the early flush of youth. A richly embroidered
Syrian gauze scarf was wrapped lightly about
her head; and her dark locks, which slightly curled, were
loosely gathered in a light golden clasp, which was ornamented
with pearls, at the back of the neck. She wore
a robe of delicate hue, which was clasped lightly about
her form, simply but richly ornamented. While outwardly
serene, there seemed to be that within the damsel
which, perchance, could be stirred into a tempest of
feeling, and melt the outward reserve by its warmth and
intensity. If there was the slight semblance of coldness,
it was so thin as to be almost transparent. She bore a
dignified air of quality, not as signifying pride or exclusiveness,
but as if the outward form was only the setting
of a precious gem. A spiritual interpreter would have
divined the subtile individual richness as rare soul-quality.
But withal her eyes were the dazzling feature
of her whole personality. They might truly be defined
as both melting and penetrative. The warmth of a pure
and lovely soul was poured out through them.
</p>

<p>
As the tumult continued, Victor Serenus turned about;
and while carelessly surveying the throng, his glance
met that of the damsel, which seemed to be intently
fastened upon him. Serenus was thrilled, as by an electric
shock, and for a moment forgot the uproar, his argument—himself.
The innocent cause of this unwonted
perturbation was Amabel, the only daughter of the Rabban.
The clamor of the throng died away, and Serenus
quickly recovered himself and continued,—
</p>

<pb n="43"/><anchor id="Pg043"/>

<p>
<q>Judaism must have a higher and freer development,
for the spirit of the law hath been killed by the letter.
O brothers of the assembly! We must free ourselves
from an entanglement of dead ordinances and ceremonies,
and be interpreters of the truth, not only to the
Gentiles, but to the families of Israel. If ye have an
indwelling experience of a divine faith, the outward letter
of sacrifices, anointings, phylacteries, and disfigured
faces is but chaff and without meaning. O my brothers!
we must, from the heart, have such a purity of mind
and thought that our very bodies shall become incarnations
of divinity. A true revelation of the Spirit of
Truth is not vouchsafed unto the worldly-wise and prudent,
but to the childlike, the poor in spirit, and the
pure in heart. The heavenly germ is within; but no
man knoweth it, until it be quickened into life, when
it bringeth forth a witness of fruits,—love, joy, peace,
and healing. I adjure you, that as ye live unto the
flesh or even after ceremonial traditions, ye shall reap
a Gehenna in yourselves and in your members. Ye say:
<q>Behold we have Abraham to our father;</q> but ye are not
his children unless ye show forth his spirit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold the blasphemer!</q> cried Saulus, interrupting.
<q>He sets at naught the religion of our fathers, and reviles
the God of Israel! He slanders the priests of the
Temple, and makes light of the Circumcision! Away
with him!</q>
</p>

<p>
Saulus and his partisans rose up to lay hold of him;
but in a moment Serenus was surrounded by a body of
defenders, who insisted that he should be heard. The
clamor increased until the chairman called upon a
cen<pb n="44"/><anchor id="Pg044"/>turion, who was in the midst, to order the tumult stayed.
The Roman captain slowly arose, and with an air of
mingled dignity and disdain, commanded silence.
</p>

<p>
<q>By the gods of Cæsar! Young Hebrews, to your
seats! Be ye circumcised or uncircumcised, the Roman
will have order, and save you from each other! Silence!
A cell in yonder Tower gapes for him who doth not
heed! Now, young disputant, finish thine oration!</q>
</p>

<p>
Victor Serenus still stood calmly in his place in the
tribune, without a trace, either of anger or fear, in his
countenance. The noise was stilled, and he resumed.
</p>

<p>
<q>Men of the assembly, and friends! The time is at
hand for a proclamation of righteousness. We declare
that the cup of Pharisaical hypocrisy and violence is
filled to the full. The spirit of the prophets of Israel
is worm-eaten and corrupted, and the ordinances of the
Law have become a stumbling-block. I proclaim deliverance
from the bondage and leadership of blind guides.
The Jewish economy must be rent in twain, and the true
separated from the false. I am persuaded that our
worthy master, the Rabban, discerns signs of reformation.
I proclaim a new heaven and a new earth; for
old things will pass away. A judgment is nigh, and will
not long tarry. The God of the whole earth is to be
worshipped by Jew and Gentile alike. The religion of
the Hebrew is to burst its bonds; for with it must be
mingled the best of the philosophy, mind, and ideals of
the Greek and other Gentile nations. The many shall
become as one, through the truth which sets men free.
I feel the spirit of prophecy upon me, and have been
constrained to give it utterance.</q>
</p>

<pb n="45"/><anchor id="Pg045"/>

<p>
He involuntarily turned, and the maiden’s eyes were
still radiantly centred upon him.
</p>

<p>
He then took his seat.
</p>

<p>
The chairman arose, and beckoned for silence.
</p>

<p>
<q>The chief disputants having made their arguments,
the discussion is now open to others.</q>
</p>

<p>
But before the last words had fallen from his lips,
Saulus was again upon his feet.
</p>

<p>
<q>The pestilent Hellenist is a base traducer of the
Chosen People.</q>
</p>

<p>
A tumult was again raised; and a score were on their
feet speaking, or beckoning for a chance to be heard.
</p>

<p>
<q>Away with the heretic!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Serenus is right!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Down with the Alexandrian!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Traitors to the Law of Moses!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The zealots are mad!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Take them to the valley of Gehenna!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Blasphemer of the holy prophets!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Great is Serenus! Defend <anchor id="corr045"/><corr sic="(single quote)">him!</corr></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Kill him, and do God service,</q> cried Saulus.
</p>

<p>
Half a score of menacing fists were stretched out
toward Serenus, while as many more forcibly held them
back. The noise of the tumult drew together a great
rabble.
</p>

<p>
The second outbreak had been so sudden that the centurion
was taken by surprise, but he again made himself
heard.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dogs of Jews!</q> he cried, <q>I am minded to let ye
devour one another as ye deserve!</q>
</p>

<p>
But after a moment’s hesitation, he continued,—
</p>

<pb n="46"/><anchor id="Pg046"/>

<p>
<q>Rome will rule the circumcised, if they cannot rule
themselves.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then calling upon two or three Roman soldiers, who
were among the throng, he gave command, pointing to
Saulus,—
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend="italic">Take him to the Tower!</hi></q>
</p>

<p>
The rabble were awed and fell back; the partisans of
Saulus melted away, and he was seized, and hurried away
to the Tower of Antonia.

<head>CHAPTER VII<lb/>A TARSIAN FESTIVAL TO APOLLO</head>

<p>
The morning was bright; and a light, cool breeze from
the Taurus mountains swept down the valley of the Cydnus,
bathing the city of Tarsus with its freshness. The
sun had just risen, and was beginning to quaff his fill of
mist and dew, and to kiss with a golden sheen the towers,
roofs, sails, and masts of the Cilician metropolis. But
though the hour was yet early, the city was already astir.
Buyers and sellers in the open markets by the city gates
were scattered in little groups, and chaffered over their
traffic with the easy air of Oriental contentment. The
streets and lanes wore a more busy aspect than was wont;
and the number of people in festal costumes, hurrying to
and fro with garlands and palm-branches in their hands,
betokened a general holiday.
</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 12"><q rend="post: none">As sweet and musical</q></l>
<l>As bright Apollo’s lute, strung with his hair;</l>
<l>And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods</l>
<l><q rend="pre: none">Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
It was the most important of the festivals of Apollo,
and was celebrated annually by a grand procession to
the chief temple of the city; followed by sacrifices,
priestly rites and ceremonies, oracular messages and
<pb n="48"/><anchor id="Pg048"/>predictions, sorcery and soothsaying, ending at night,
with orgies which characterized the Oriental city of the
period.
</p>

<p>
The main temple with its oracle, consecrated to the
gods of Tarsus, was situated in the midst of a large garden
in the extreme northwestern, or most elevated part
of the city. It commanded a charming view of the beautiful
Cydnus for nearly its whole length, as it wound its
way, like a silver thread, through the plain in its course
from the distant mountains to the sea. The ground
about the temple was tastefully laid out with walks,
vine-clad summer-houses, fountains, grottos, groups of
sycamore and palm trees, and at short intervals adorned
with statues, vases, and other creations of Greek art and
handiwork.
</p>

<p>
The blossoms of the bending branches of spicy plants
loaded the air with sweet odors, which held the visitor
in the delicate bonds of a subtile enchantment. The
oleander and jasmine, rose and lilac, tulip and lily, each
lent its charm to the chorus of beauty and exhalation.
Bounteous Nature was drawn upon to the utmost for rich
contributions to consecrate Apollo’s great temple-garden,
and enhance its mystical fascination.
</p>

<p>
In threading one’s way through this sensuous paradise,
one would often find himself at the entrance of some
graceful booth, where a priest or priestess of Apollo
would dispense love-philtres, or be inquired of concerning
the misty future, peradventure to its complete unveiling.
</p>

<p>
The temple itself was built of Parian marble, and
surrounded by a porch, with a row of lofty Corinthian
<pb n="49"/><anchor id="Pg049"/>columns in front, and a corresponding peristyle, surmounted
by an entablature, stretching out from either
side. The pediments were richly covered with designs
in <foreign rend="italic">alto-rilievo</foreign>. Among them were representations of
Apollo, Diana, the setting sun, Hercules slaying the
Hydra, Dionysus and a Giant, Fauns, Bacchantes, and
triumphal processions. In the <foreign rend="italic">pronaos</foreign>, or vestibule,
there was a series of broad panels, upon which were
inscribed maxims from the Seven Sages of Greece.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the vestibule, on either side were two overflowing
fountains, each surrounded with statues of Triton,
Neptune, Amphitrite, Apollo slaying the great serpent
Pytho, with other gods, goddesses, Nymphs, and Dryads.
Invalids who drank of a certain fountain, or bathed in it,
and were healed, threw pieces of money into it as a recompense.
In the back part of the <foreign rend="italic">cella</foreign> was the great
hearth with the perpetual fire; and in the <foreign rend="italic">adytum</foreign>, or
inner shrine, were the sacred tripod and other mysteries
of the sanctum. Below this was a subterranean chamber,
from the sacred recesses of which ascended the vapor of
prophecy.
</p>

<p>
The oracular messages were often conveyed by dreams,
preceding which, fasting was customary, followed by sacrifices,
and sleeping upon the skin of the animal which
had been offered. Other auguries were received in writing,
sometimes by means of the <q>descending pencil</q>
which hung suspended, and wrote by invisible, though
intelligent and fateful impulse. Sealed communications
on parchment also received answers from occult and
mysterious sources.
</p>

<p>
Magic, prophecy, and oracular deliverances were not
<pb n="50"/><anchor id="Pg050"/>peculiar to the great Oracle at Delphi, but common in
the less noted temples of other cities. The offices of
priest and soothsayer were blended. The favor and
guidance of the gods were invoked upon every undertaking,
and through sacrifice and propitiation offered
their friendly aid was bestowed. Nothing was undertaken
without their sanction, whether going to war, engaging
in business, or making love. The healing of
invalids, augury, and the interpretation of visions, were
not only legal and ethical, but they formed an integral
part of religion.
</p>

<p>
To the modern student of mental phenomena it is
interesting to look back upon the multiform manifestations
of mind in the past. Under the reign of polytheism,
everything—including even the inner psychological
forces that are common to all—was deified. Each phenomenon
was due to the action of some <q>god.</q> But
after all, when we get below the surface of things, is the
change a very radical one? The <q>god,</q> with them, is
some divine orderly law with us. Either term involves
the idea of a force which is more or less mysterious.
They were destitute of the understanding of the inherent
unity and inter-relation of all things, and consequently
each phenomenon was disconnected from its relations,
and directly credited to a special deity. There was no
idea of a great comprehensive Unit. The universe of
mind and matter was a fragmentary mass. Its various
factions were presided over by deities who were often
warring against each other. The great modern inspiration
is, not only cosmic oneness, but universality of law.
Even the monotheism of the Jew was largely mechanical
and incongruous.
</p>

<pb n="51"/><anchor id="Pg051"/>

<p>
Law as all pervading with the latest refinement—its
unvarying beneficence, when correctly interpreted—furnishes
the key which will resolve age-long mysteries.
With the present understanding of the creative power of
mental states, and the potency of thought, even when
set in motion by motives of pure superstition, much of
the remarkable phenomena of the past can be interpreted
and rendered congruous. The prophecies, oracular messages,
healings, divinations, soothsaying, and other <q>miraculous</q>
transactions of history, though doubtless often
exaggerated, have an important basis of truth. They are
in accord with the legitimate or illegitimate use of laws
now measurably understood. As we become increasingly
aware of the possibilities of hypnotism, telepathy, the
sub-conscious mind, suggestion, psychical development,
and spiritualistic experiences, the strange things of both
ancient and later times are seen to be natural and explainable.
The so-called <q>supernatural</q> was just what
might have been expected under the known conditions.
There was no suspension of universal law, but only the
orderly result of real forces which exist in man, even
though often unrecognized and misused.
</p>

<p>
Under both the Gentile and Jewish economies, there
was an endless mass of occurrences, attributed to special
deific intervention, but all belong to the realm of the
one Divine unchangeable and universal order. This has
never been suspended and never will be, for God does
not contradict himself. Prophets and priests could perform
<q>wonderful works</q> through the medium of principles
which they could not define. Miraculous colorings
are always in the eyes of the beholder. Human
equip<pb n="52"/><anchor id="Pg052"/>ment, which has had much unintelligent employment, is
now clearly interpreted.
</p>

<p>
But withal, it may be questioned, whether it be not
better to attribute too much to <q>the gods</q> than—like
some moderns—to become so coldly agnostic and <hi rend="italic">pseudo</hi>-scientific
as to deny everything which is above the plane
of the material and sensuous.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p>
<q>The gods favored thee, fair lady.</q>
</p>

<p>
These words were addressed to Rebecca, the daughter
of Benoni.
</p>

<p>
She turned to see from whence they came.
</p>

<p>
<q>Say not the gods, my good woman, but the God of
Israel.</q>
</p>

<p>
Rebecca and her father were returning from the morning
service of the synagogue, and had halted for a moment
to make some trifling purchase at a small bazaar. Rebecca
observed that the woman who had spoken, and
who seemed to be an assistant in the bazaar, was surveying
her with unwonted interest.
</p>

<p>
<q>What would’st thou?</q> said the Jewish maiden.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forgive me, but thy sweet face brings a terrible vision
before me. Thou hast not forgotten the <hi rend="italic">palace</hi> and the
<hi rend="italic">storm</hi>?</q>
</p>

<p>
The scene of two years before flashed upon her. A
shudder ran through her frame. Her color fled, and for
a brief moment she again lived over the tragic experience.
But waving aside the hideous recollection,
she quickly commanded herself, and greeted Chloe
with a warm salutation, and then turning to her father,
said,—
</p>

<pb n="53"/><anchor id="Pg053"/>

<p>
<q>O my father! this is the woman who led our way out
of the lion’s den.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The blessing of the God of The Chosen People be
upon thee,</q> said Benoni. <q>His thunderbolts and your
good guidance gave me back my scions. Art thou yet a
slave?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alas! I am still in bondage.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will pay thy ransom; and, if thou wilt, thou shalt
serve in my house for liberal hire.</q>
</p>

<p>
Chloe fell on her knees, and with tears of gratitude
thanked her kind benefactor in the name of all
the gods, but was again reminded of the Hebrew Jehovah.
</p>

<p>
Just then the distant echoes of cymbals, trumpets, and
songs, which betokened the coming of the great festal
procession, fell upon the ears of the trio. It was manifest
that its line of march was to be directly through the
street into which the portal of the bazaar opened, where
they were standing. Casting their eyes down the long
vista toward the approaching column, they were spellbound
by its grandeur as it threaded its way with slow
elastic rhythm through the crowded thoroughfare. It
was on its joyous march to the garden and temple of
Apollo.
</p>

<p>
Benoni was first to break the silence.
</p>

<p>
<q>Verily, the heathen rage and imagine a vain thing,
but the enemies of the Lord shall yet be sore vexed.</q>
</p>

<p>
Soon the thud of hoofs and the rumble of wheels betokened
a company of charioteers which composed the
advance division of the pageant. Each chariot was
richly decorated with chaplets and ribbons, and drawn
<pb n="54"/><anchor id="Pg054"/>by three horses abreast, of the same color, all gorgeously
caparisoned.
</p>

<p>
The charioteers were chanting a chorus:—
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="post: none">Since life’s so short, we’ll live to laugh.</q></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah! wherefore waste a minute!</l>
<l>If youth’s the cup we yet can quaff,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre: none">Be love the pearl within it!</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
Near the front, and abreast of each other, were two
charioteers who merit a description somewhat more in
detail. The prancing steeds driven by one were snowy
white, and those of the other jet black. The driver of
the latter was tall and erect, with head thrown back,
long black curly hair, dark complexion, strong face,
Roman nose, and a physical organization which might
be the envy of an athlete. His head was bare, with the
exception of a wreath of myrtle, likewise his throat,
arms, and legs below the knee. His tunic was of crimson
fabric, woven of silk, gathered by a girdle of gold
chain, and clasped in front by an elaborate jewelled
ornament.
</p>

<p>
The other was more delicate in complexion, with wavy
brown hair, dark blue eyes, and refined features of the
Grecian cast. A chaplet of laurel encircled his brow,
his throat and arms were bare, and an easy gracefulness
characterized every movement. The skirt of his belted
tunic, of soft white woollen fabric, dropped to the knee,
and was decorated with a border of gold embroidery.
The throat, arms, and legs, where exposed, had a pearly
whiteness which betokened a perfect service of baths,
oils, and polishing. He was lighter in build and less
<pb n="55"/><anchor id="Pg055"/>stern in demeanor than his companion, and there was a
sparkle in his eyes which certified to a warm and poetic
temperament. They had arrived at a point just opposite
where the three were standing, when Chloe gave a start,
and turning, grasped the arm of Rebecca.
</p>

<p>
<q>See! see! It is</q>—
</p>

<p>
But the fair Jewess recognized them at the same moment,
and quickly turned her back upon the cruel faces
of hateful recollection.

<head>CHAPTER VIII<lb/>THE MYSTERIES OF THE <foreign rend="italic">ADYTUM</foreign></head>

<p>
Tarsus gave itself up with full abandon to the festival.
The Tarsian religion of the period, though outwardly
adorned by the polish of Greek art, letters, and
philosophy, was largely orgiastic and Oriental in its internal
character. The popular faith contained a strange
mixture of Greek, Roman, Phrygian, Phœnician, and
even Egyptian elements, for the mingling of which the
intermediate situation of the Cilician metropolis was
especially favorable. In Greece itself, a terrible decadence
had taken place since the earlier philosophy and
idealism of Pythagoras, Socrates, and Plato; but in Tarsus,
the religion, though nominally Grecian, was permeated
with the fanaticism and magic of Eastern cults.
It was sensual, superstitious, and spectacular, though it
had an iridescent Hellenic film of grace and beauty.
</p>

<p>
But with all the depravity of the period, there was a
spontaneity and natural optimism, which, while not
atoning for its excesses, should not be left out of the
account. A hard and narrow asceticism, which during
mediæval ages made life <q>a bed of spikes,</q> was the
future great sweep of the human pendulum to the other
extreme. If there was less seriousness, there was at the
same time less pessimism and morbidity. The ripening
<pb n="57"/><anchor id="Pg057"/>process in humanity is a matter of millenniums, and
only in the broad sunshine of the higher evolutionary
philosophy can proper adjustments and allowances for
wide vibrations be made.
</p>

<p>
The law of correspondence is universal. The relation
between the seen and the unseen is not only intimate but
perfectly fitting. The soul, whether of low or high attainment,
has its extension into, and connection with,
spiritual forces of its own quality and on its own plane.
By a subtle mysterious union, each mingles with its
own. Like attracts like. But yet lives of selfishness
and sensuality have within them the germs of finer instincts;
and sooner or later, when needed lessons have
been learned, there will be a drawing upward of the
divinity, now latent within, toward its transcendent
correspondence, even though the recognition long be
dim.
</p>

<p>
Evil is a misdirection of forces within that are good
<foreign rend="italic">per se</foreign>.
</p>

<p>
Every one has some supreme ideal; and for the present
this concept, even though low and limited, is to him
godlike—in fact, his god. Human ideals of God are
ever to rise and become more perfect, for man has all
potentiality within him.
</p>

<p>
Linked with all the corruption of the sensuous age in
question, there was a strong impulse toward worship.
Pantheism recognized a divine ordination of all possible
unseen forces, as well as seen objects; and then, in order
not to miss the fulness of religion, it erected altars to
the <q>unknown God.</q> The instinct of deific devotion
was great in quantity, but low in quality. The sacred
<pb n="58"/><anchor id="Pg058"/>mysteries were all absorbing, but took little hold upon
the moral nature.
</p>

<p>
Weighed by the delicate but immutable balances of
thought-quality, the morals of the various ages might
not be so dissimilar. Vice is no less vice when it is
secretive. The world has learned to dissemble. Before
the present age can greatly boast of its own moral purity,
as compared with that of the past, it must apply the
inner as well as the external test. Even low instincts,
when idealized and sanctified, are in some measure purified
by the quality of thought concerning them. If by
the accepted ethics of one age, a certain course of conduct
be not only regular but correct, and by those of
another low and vile, who shall declare that their moral
quality is identical? Judgment, to be just, must be
tempered, or at least somewhat relative rather than absolute.
An age which held that every real force, sex-principle,
and sensuous or artistic instinct was some
manifestation of, or in close relation with the Deity, or
deities, should be studied in the clarifying light of the
evolutionary philosophy.
</p>

<p>
While the majority of the Tarsian population did not
join the procession, they generally surrendered fully to
the exuberant spirit of the occasion, thereby pleasing
themselves and gaining the favor of the gods. The
morning was superb; and the great moving human panorama
began to unroll itself from the lower part of the
city, in a stream, kaleidoscopic in its changes, toward
the temple. The chariots, in column two abreast, led
the way, crowding back the dense mass of people on
either side, thereby clearing a path for the less resistant
<pb n="59"/><anchor id="Pg059"/>portions of the great procession. These were followed
by companies of men, dressed in various symbolic costumes,
bearing offerings and instruments which pertained
to the mysteries of prophecy, music, poetry, and medicine,
and the other arts and muses. Some bore banners,
inscribed with occult signs and emblems; others swung
smoking censers with a slow rhythmical measure which
corresponded to the march. Then followed a long procession
of girls, chanting and dancing to the measured
time of the music of tabourets and harps which vibrated
to their own light touch. Their long hair was thrown
loosely back to the soft breeze; their faces, necks, and
arms fully exposed to the sunlight, and their lithe,
shapely forms and white limbs were but lightly veiled
by free-flowing pink or golden-hued robes. There were
priests wearing tall cone-shaped hats, and priestesses
with hair coiled and intertwined with symbolic leaves,
flowers, and garlands, some wearing charms and amulets,
and waving their wands to the beat of the movement.
Some bore bunches of grapes or other fruits, and
others carried small cornucopias of spices and sweets for
their rich odors and for consumption upon the altars
which were about the temple. There were also cows,
sheep, and goats, bedecked with trappings, ribbons, and
garlands, for sacrifice, or other symbolic ceremonies and
priestly rites.
</p>

<p>
Everything beautiful in nature,—its flowers, trees,
birds, air, and sunshine, lent their charm for the enrichment
of the service to the Tarsian gods, and the honor
of their temple. The chariots of Marcius and Leander
were prominent in the procession, side by side.
</p>

<pb n="60"/><anchor id="Pg060"/>

<p>
<q>Shades of Daphne! Marcius, I saw old Chloe, and
a beautiful young Jewess with her, in the rabble just
past.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! I have seen the features of that charmer before!
Mine eyes deceive me not! Dost thou recall the storm,
the lightning, the crash, and thine own discomfiture?
Methinks thou wert dreaming at that particular moment.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By Pallas! I am not unmindful that the gods kept us
from a threatened descent to the shades of Pluto.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, my gallant! But with that I cannot forget that
the cage was rent, and the bird flew out.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Send regrets to the breezes, stern Roman! The Muse
whispers that we may yet,—</q>
</p>

<l>While the stream shall flow, and the sky shall glow,</l>
<l><q rend="pre: none">The Beautiful still is ours.’</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
<q>A truce to thine overflowing poetic sentiment, Leander;
but to return to events. Dost thou think that old Chloe
recognized us?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Peradventure not, though her eyes are sharp; but
what recks it? Doubtless she thinks we perished in the
ruin, else she would have returned. The dead has
buried its dead.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But the dead sometimes rise, my effeminate Greek.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Dost thou believe in spirits?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Too well I know them. They are more in number
than the gods.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What of signs, omens, and dreams?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I believe the most impossible dreams may become
true.</q>
</p>

<pb n="61"/><anchor id="Pg061"/>

<p>
<q>Dost thou think there are life and feeling and motion
beyond the Styx, Marcius?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Shades of Hades! I do. But I would rather be a
slave beneath the sun than a king in the Cimmerian
regions of the under-world.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">I believe nothing, Marcius. Thou art superstitious.
Show me a shade from the under-world, and I will give
him a hearty greeting.</q>
</p>

<lg>
<l>‘Away with your stories of Hades,</l>
<l>Which the Flamen has forged to affright us.</l>
<l>We laugh at your three Maiden Ladies,</l>
<l><q rend="pre: none">Your Fates—and your sullen Cocytus.’</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
<q>A graceful turn to a shady subject, and quite worthy
of thine ever ready Muse. But, nevertheless, shades there
are, my poet, and perchance they may yet give thee an
unwelcome greeting.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Black or white, I invite them!</q>
</p>

<lg>
<l>‘Oh! blest be the bright Epicurus,</l>

<l>On Hades they wanted to moor us,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2"><q rend="pre: none">But his hand cut the terrible cables.’</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
<q>We approach the temple. I have heard that in the
mysterious recesses of the <foreign rend="italic">adytum</foreign> one may receive, not
only responses from the Oracle, but, perchance, messages
from the ghosts of the departed. Wilt thou enter the
inner shrine, and envelop thyself in the vapor of mystical
enchantment?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will gladly greet all the shapeless spirits that come,
even an endless procession, but I count them dull and
insipid. Give me shapely form and graceful feature! I
quaff real wine and not an empty goblet.</q>
</p>

<pb n="62"/><anchor id="Pg062"/>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">We will penetrate to the heart of the mysteries and
inquire our fate. The gods grant us an unveiling.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But see! We are at the end of our route, and the
temple with all its riches is before us. Thou hast
managed thy steeds well, luxurious Greek. Charioteer!
poet! gallant! and now seeker of mysteries!</q>
</p>

<p>
The procession wound gracefully through the peristyle
on one side and back on the other, thence into the
avenues of the great garden, finally losing itself and
melting away in its intricate mazes.
</p>

<p>
After sending away their chariots by attendants, Marcius
and Leander lingered for some time among the
bowers and grottoes of the temple grounds.
</p>

<p>
Among the bewildering charms of the garden was a
shimmering pond in its midst, the banks of which were
decked with groves of lotus and blooming rose-trees.
Clustered around the numerous statues, delicate jets of
perfumed water threw up their fine spray, and loaded the
air with aromatic fragrance. Graceful shallops, shaped
like swans or fish, moved about in the pond, filled with
lightly draped rowers of both sexes, whose gilded oars
kept time to the music of harps and citharæ, played by
girls in unnumbered smaller craft which circled around
them. Some were dressed as Sirens, covered with green
net-work in imitation of scales. Trooping out from
among high clusters of plants and flowers were groups
disguised as Fauns, Satyrs, Nymphs, and Dryads, playing
on tabourets, drums, flutes, or tambourines. The water
of the pond responsively heaved to the rhythm of oars
which beat in unison. As night drew on, the echoes of
voices, horns, and trumpets grew louder; and the votaries
<pb n="63"/><anchor id="Pg063"/>of Bacchus and Venus, amid shouts and laughter, threw
all restraint to the winds. On the shores and terraces
shone swarms of lights, while other parts of the groves
were dark and hidden.
</p>

<p>
It was late in the evening when Marcius and Leander,
satiated and sobered by the excesses of the day, entered,
arm in arm, the <foreign rend="italic">pronaos</foreign> of the temple. On each side
were low seats, comfortably cushioned; and by a mutual
impulse they sat down for a little rest before penetrating
farther into the interior. The Roman seemed in a
dejected mood. His black eyes were heavy and dull;
and his mien, usually so haughty and imperious, was
tame and passive. He turned towards Leander.
</p>

<p>
<q>Life is a hollow mockery. When shall my eyes open
to the true Olympus, where real gods make their abode?
I feel a strange unrest, and confess myself weary of the
Tarsian deities.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, my high and mighty Marcius! Thou art downcast
to-night. Get rid of thyself,—that is, drive away
thy thoughts.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My thoughts are too deep to be rooted out. They
hold me in thraldom! Genius decays! Vice vanquishes
virtue! How will it all end? What has the
unseen future in store for us?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Leave the future! The gods serve us to-day as we
serve them. To-day! to-day is all!</q>
</p>

<lg>
<l>‘If hope is lost and freedom fled,</l>
<l><q rend="pre: none">The more excuse for pleasure.’</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
<q>By all the divinities of Rome! Nothing less than
the oars of Charon himself will ever break thine
ever<pb n="64"/><anchor id="Pg064"/>lasting trail of poetry. But a truce to thy chatter! Let
us to the Mysteries and inquire our respective fates!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perchance they will brighten thy spirits and calm
thy temper.</q>
</p>

<p>
Slowly rising, they made their way into the <foreign rend="italic">cella</foreign> of the
temple.
</p>

<p>
The perpetual fire was burning upon the great sacred
hearth; and before it were a few persons who had prostrated
themselves, each waiting the slow turn for their
introduction to the inner Mysteries. The <foreign rend="italic">cella</foreign> was unlighted
save by the fitful glare of the fire on the hearth.
The strange symbols and inscriptions which covered the
walls and ceiling produced a weird and unearthly effect.
</p>

<p>
In a recess, just above the fire, were great gilded, interlaced
triangles, and over those the symbolic Winged
Globe. These were surrounded with divine monograms,
emblems of the powers of Nature. On the ceiling was
a large design of the crux Ansata, the oldest known hieroglyph,
also the Greek divine Logos representing inner
illumination. The walls were covered with other mysterious
characters,—the key of Hermes, the serpent in
a circle, cabalistic names, a talisman of Pythagoras,
monogram of Fire, or the generative principle, symbolisms
of the divine Wreath, hieroglyph of Eros, monograms
of the three Delphic mysteries and the re-born
soul. Harps of Æolia which hung in the valves of the
outer walls filled the air with sweet and plaintive melody
in fitful measure.
</p>

<p>
Marcius and Leander waited for a full hour at the
sacred fire for the numbers to be called which would
give them their turn for an introduction to the inner
<pb n="65"/><anchor id="Pg065"/><foreign rend="italic">Mysteria Sacra</foreign>. A feeling of awe gradually crept
through their souls—a sense of having left the world
behind. Unseen influences were bearing down upon
them. The hieroglyphs seemed alive and engaged in
an ominous dance, frowning upon them and calling them
to judgment. They grasped each other’s hands, and
looked into each other’s eyes to reassure themselves.
</p>

<p>
At length the number of Marcius was called, and he
was ushered into the <foreign rend="italic">adytum</foreign>. The valve closed behind
him; and as he passed forward, there hung, directly
overhead, a great flaming symbol of the <foreign rend="italic">Mysteria Eleusinia</foreign>.
Its brightness slowly faded until, in a little time,
it only cast a dim blue ghastly light in flashes, so that
he could see but indistinctly. He was impelled still farther
on, and soon a cool breeze swept gently up from
cavernous depths below. The walls melted and retreated;
and the courageous Roman, nearly overcome, pinched
himself to find if he were still in the body. He involuntarily
turned to retreat, but the valve had disappeared.
</p>

<p>
<q>Am I alive? or is this Hades?</q>
</p>

<p>
But see! a vapor ascends in the dim blue light from
the cavernous realm below. It winds itself upward, and
anon within it there are great forbidding and uncanny
Shapes; and with bedeviled mien, leering faces, and ominous
gestures they beckon to Marcius.
</p>

<p>
Soon a pungent aromatic odor diffused itself through
the air, which mysteriously stilled his excited senses so
that he regained his wonted composure.
</p>

<p>
The column of vapor rolled itself up, growing more
dense, and anon something like a defined form slowly
gathered itself together from it. For a little time the
<pb n="66"/><anchor id="Pg066"/>dim misty light only revealed indistinct outlines; but soon
it grew clearer, and advanced a step toward Marcius, a
part of the vaporous cloud forming a soft background.
The transformation now became rapid, and anon there
stood before him a beautiful young woman. With a flash
of recognition the heart of the Roman leaped to his
throat.
</p>

<p>
<q>Marcius!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alethea!</q>
</p>

<p>
The light increased; and the form, in every detail,
stood out with lifelike color and distinctness. She
wore a long silvery white robe, the folds of which were
lightly gathered by a girdle, and swept in easy lines to
her feet. The bare neck, arms, and shoulders were of a
pale rose-color or flesh-tint, and the bosom palpitated
with emotion. The face was clear, calm, and natural,
with an expression of sadness about the eyes; and the
blond hair, thrown lightly behind the shoulders, reached
below the waist. There was breath and life.
</p>

<p>
<q>Alethea! Dost thou still live? Was thy death, then,
an idle tale? Whence camest thou to this place?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Marcius! I come from the world of spirits.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Surely, thou art no ghost! Thy bosom heaves with
life, and thine eyes glisten with warm emotion. Let me
again fold thy beautiful form to my breast, and feel thy
warm breath; for I love thee still.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Marcius! thou wert false, <hi rend="italic">heartless—cruel</hi>! I loved
thee with a pure and single devotion. After deceiving
me, thou didst cast me off.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, say not so! Try me once again and I will be</q>—
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay, thy time has past. Thou art incapable of love,
<pb n="67"/><anchor id="Pg067"/>and it shall remain unknown to thee. Thy baseness
hath blasted it forever! From henceforth the world
shall be to thee a wilderness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Alethea! curse me not! Thou art living flesh and
blood! Thou hast not died! Come to me once more!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Marcius, I curse thee not! but mortals must reap as
they have sown.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not so! I will persuade thee! Alethea, thou shalt
again be mine!</q>
</p>

<p>
He advanced, and clasped her in his embrace. But
his arms encircled only the <hi rend="italic">thin, cold air</hi>.
</p>

<p>
It grew suddenly dark, and voices and groans and
shrieks echoed from all directions. Thrusting his fingers
in his ears, and with a chill which penetrated to his
very bones, he turned and fled to the <foreign rend="italic">cella</foreign>.

<p>
The tumultuous concourse at Gamaliel’s Lyceum dispersed;
and Saulus was conveyed, under guard, to the
Tower of Antonia. Amabel, who had remained in her
seat, catching every note of the disputation with intense
interest until its end, stole quietly through the boisterous
throng as it hurried into the street, and rapidly made her
way toward home. The palace of her father, the Rabban,
was situated on Mount Zion, a little to the northeast of
the palace of Herod, and commanded a fine view of the
Holy City and its environs. As she passed into the
entrance-hall, she started directly to acquaint her father
with the scene at the Lyceum, but found herself stirred
by emotions so unusual that she was impelled to pass
the portal of his library, and go quietly to her own apartment.
She must have time to think. The air seemed
oppressive; and she hurriedly made her way to the house-top,
where there was a secluded nook to which she often
resorted for study and meditation. Throwing herself
into an easy seat, which was sheltered by a light canopy,
she mechanically looked down upon the gilded towers,
domes, and white roofs which were spread out below.
</p>

<pb n="69"/><anchor id="Pg069"/>

<p>
The sun, which was just sinking, seemed to linger a
little upon the summit of the western mountains, sportively
shooting back his rays, and tinting through and
through the fleecy cloud-forms which hung lightly over
the city, burnishing its bastioned walls and battlements.
Just across the valley of the Cheesemongers, and crowning
the summit of Mount Moriah, was the great Temple, with
its endless courts, each marked by long rows of white
marble columns, and proudly lifting itself in the midst
of all, the Holy of Holies, wearing a crown of beaten
gold. Here was the head and heart of Judaism, including
its religion, history, law, prophecy, and patriotism,
now, alas! shackled by the heavy hand of Rome, so that
even the simplest daily ritual was only possible by the
gracious permission of the enemy. From the valley immediately
to the north the Towers of Mariamne, Phasælus,
and Hippicus lifted their proud heads; while to the
east, beyond the Kedron, the bold steeps of the Mount
of Olives, scantily clothed with fig-trees and wild olives,
were softened and bathed in a purple haze, the parting
gift of the orb of day. Jerusalem, and the mountains
round about her, were suffused with an ambient air of
peace and serenity.
</p>

<p>
But the soul of Amabel did not reflect the calm of the
world outside. She gave but a passing glance to the
familiar surroundings which were wont to be so attractive,
because a new world within, but just discovered,
demanded attention.
</p>

<p>
As the loving and dutiful daughter of the Rabban,
she was loyal to her religion and people. She had been
feared and educated in the light of its more liberal
<pb n="70"/><anchor id="Pg070"/>teachings, and was deeply interested in their promulgation
and dominance. But the broader spiritual liberalism
of Victor Serenus appealed deeply to her. She
started to review his earnest arguments, but was surprised
to find that her thoughts constantly glanced from the
oration to the orator. After several attempts at calm
reasoning, Amabel became impatient with herself. Intellectually
gifted, she never before had failed in the
efficient command of her faculties. Her interest in religion
had been vital, and her devotion thorough; but all
at once they seemed to have faded in the light of a new
vision which proved rudely aggressive. Again she tried
to gather up the eloquent line of reasoning; but anon a
mental image, its noble bearing, graceful gestures, manly
form, and most peculiarly <q>those eyes</q> seemed fastened
upon her.
</p>

<p>
<q>What have I to do with thee?</q>
</p>

<p>
Her own question gave her a shock.
</p>

<p>
<q>My logic never before hath denied me service. Thou
mysterious, stately, haunting stranger! Why doth thine
eyes shine upon me, and thy form possess my imagination?
I bid thee adieu!</q>
</p>

<p>
But beyond her control something had taken shape and
life, and stood before her, at the sight of which she was
thrilled and spellbound. It was an Ideal—her Ideal.
</p>

<p>
<q>Away, airy phantom! I will be myself!</q>
</p>

<p>
But an ideal that fits its place takes possession. It
persistently makes itself at home, and receives, not only
deserved recognition, but a conscious or unconscious
welcome.
</p>

<p>
She tried to step outside of herself and look in, in
<pb n="71"/><anchor id="Pg071"/>order to interpret, if possible, the vision from an impartial
standpoint. Its charm was not lessened.
</p>

<p>
A mind may be deeply intuitive, and even philosophical,
and yet naïve and artless. With a delightful and
childlike simplicity, Amabel was unconscious of her
own loveliness.
</p>

<p>
She threw aside the light scarf from her head; and her
hair, somewhat disordered by the light breeze, played
about the ivory neck which her light robe partially displayed.
Her cheeks were flushed, and her large dark
eyes unwontedly shining and liquid. Again she turned
her gaze within. More truly, the new and mysterious
Thing which had possessed her was there, rather than in
the distance. Its correspondence or occasion might be
without, but it was a subjective force which stirred the
Hebrew maiden’s heart. There was a new, unfathomable,
and heavenly quickening. Something had been awakened
which no power on earth could turn back to its native
slumbering latency.
</p>

<p>
The evening drew on, but she was unconscious of the
flight of time. A charming and divine unrest, which she
could not dislodge if she would, filled her soul. O
daughter of humanity! who shall interpret thee to thyself?
</p>

<p>
She looked out upon the lamps that twinkled over the
Holy City, but saw only the Ideal. The soft evening
breeze that fanned her cheek whispered of it, and even
the starry heavens smiled upon her and reflected it back.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 8"/>

<p>
The time sped on. Amabel was missed from the
evening family repast; and it was only after some
appre<pb n="72"/><anchor id="Pg072"/>hension and search that she was aroused from her revery,
and took her accustomed place in the household. It
was taken for granted that she had been sleeping.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p>
Early on the following morning, Victor Serenus made
his way to the palace of Gamaliel, and sought an audience
with the Rabban. This was not difficult for any
member of the assembly; and, besides, Serenus was influential
and favored. He was cordially received, and
after being shown to a seat proceeded to unfold the purpose
of his visit.
</p>

<p>
<q>Most worthy Rabban, I crave thine indulgence for
this liberty, but would make a request in behalf of a
fellow-student.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What would’st thou, Serenus?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Perchance thou hast received a report of the tumult
which took place yesterday at the Lyceum.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have been informed of the disorder, and also of the
arrest of Saulus.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is this which prompted me to call, and petition for
thy clemency and intervention in his behalf.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Was he not the leader of the disturbance, and did he
not insult and attack thee?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It was as thou sayest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Doth not, then, his punishment seem fitting?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Most excellent master, it is plain that such would
be the regular order of procedure. A centurion was
witness to the offence, and gave order for the arrest.
But yet I seek thy intervention for his pardon and release.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I do not understand thee, Serenus! Would’st thou
<pb n="73"/><anchor id="Pg073"/>have me set at naught the ends of justice, even when
administered by the unrighteous Roman?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Pardon, noble teacher, but Saulus is young and
vehement. His zeal hath hidden his wisdom, and I am
persuaded that by this hour he may repent. He is exceeding
jealous for the faith of the Chosen People, even
though the spirit be swallowed up by the letter.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is he still thy opponent, or dost thou come to me at
his request?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Worthy Rabban, as my opponent, I forgive him. He
is unaware of my petition, and I would that he be not
informed of the same.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Serenus, thou art a noble student, goodly in spirit
and conduct, even though thou seemest to have but light
regard for our traditions. I commend thee for thy good-will
toward thy fellow-disciple, and will freely grant thy
request. I am persuaded that I can compass his release
without formal trial, for his transgression is of slight
moment to the Romans. It was but an excess of youthful
zeal.</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus was about to take his leave, when Amabel
hastily entered the library to make some slight request
of her father. It was too late to retreat, and in the
twinkling of an eye she unexpectedly found herself
face to face with her own heroic mystery of the previous
evening. The Rabban had a kind heart, and
without hesitation presented his gifted pupil to his
daughter.
</p>

<p>
Serenus made a graceful salutation, and at once recognized
the radiant eyes which had so disconcerted him at
the Lyceum. He was about to quietly withdraw, feeling
<pb n="74"/><anchor id="Pg074"/>that the forced introduction gave no warrant for conversation,
when Amabel broke the silence.
</p>

<p>
<q>I was present at the debate yesterday, and much interested
in thine argument.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah! I recall thy face as one that I noticed in the
gallery of the women, but was unaware that it was the
daughter of the Rabban who thus honored me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Both thy reasoning and calm self-command were
much to thy favor,</q> she softly replied; and then the
thought of her boldness disconcerted her, and brought a
sudden flush of rich color to her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
A thought flashed upon Serenus, <q>How beautiful!</q>
but the conversation was not further continued.
</p>

<p>
But immediately regaining his composure, he graciously
thanked the Rabban and his daughter, and took
his leave. But those large liquid eyes haunted him.
They seemed to be the outlet for a beautiful soul which
spoke through them.
</p>

<p>
Gamaliel repaired to the Tower of Antonia; and as
no charge of violation of Roman law had been entered
against Saulus, the Rabban’s plea that the offence was
but a youthful misdemeanor was sufficient, and the young
Jew was set free. He was only made aware that he
received his liberty through the influence of Gamaliel,
and at once inferred from this intercession that the
master was willing to forgive, or perchance approve, his
over-zealous conduct on account of his unwavering faithfulness
to doctrine.
</p>

<p>
After a light reprimand, he passed out from beneath
the frowning battlements of the Tower, and returned to
his lodging in the Sheepmarket. A warm greeting was
<pb n="75"/><anchor id="Pg075"/>given by the innkeeper and his family. They were surprised
to behold him at liberty; and Cassia was unwontedly
joyful, but her swollen eyes gave evidence of recent
weeping.
</p>

<p>
The family of Almon were Pharisees of the strictest
sect; and the inn was the resort of a faction, composed
of certain members of the assembly, of whom Saulus was
the acknowledged leader and champion.
</p>

<p>
<q>My young friend,</q> said Almon, warmly saluting him,
<q>how didst thou so soon loosen the iron grip of the
Roman?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Verily, mine host Almon, the Rabban takes care of
his own. Even the Gentile tyrant holdeth him in respect.
I am persuaded that his immediate intercession may be
a sign that the heresy of that apostate, Serenus, is to be
overthrown.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Were the keepers at the Tower kind to thee during
thy captivity?</q> inquired Cassia, with deep interest.
</p>

<p>
<q>Fair Cassia, I suffered no harm at their hands.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Surely, thou art wearied, and must needs have rest
and nourishment speedily.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My rest and refreshment will be to bring to naught
the betrayers of the faith of Israel, whether of the Jews
or Gentiles!</q>
</p>

<p>
The maiden kept her fan in rapid motion, and nodded
her satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
<q>Cæsar hath his foot on our necks,</q> continued Saulus;
<q>but the time draweth nigh when it will slip, and we
shall arise. We are the seed of Abraham; and though
every Roman were a Cæsar, we shall throw off our yoke.
The keepers of covenants will inherit their promised
<pb n="76"/><anchor id="Pg076"/>rewards, and the pulse of every Hebrew throbs at the
coming deliverance. By the light of Judean prophecy,
I have a vision of the proud Roman as trodden dust.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>May the rising and setting of the sun be hastened,</q>
said Almon, <q>when the Circumcision shall inherit the
earth! But, O Lord of our fathers! how long? The
tramp of Roman legions shakes the land until it trembles
like a threshing-floor beaten with flails! The breast of
the Holy City is bruised with hammers until her blood
flows, and she is covered with wounds! Our holy places
are contemned, the oil of our anointing is wasted, and
our burnt offerings are defiled!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is even so, O Almon; but Jehovah will spoil the
power of Rome, and the sophistry of the Greek will be
an abomination. The horns of the Altar will be exalted,
and the Gentile bow to the wisdom of the Jew. But the
heathen never knew the God of Israel, and therefore cannot
forget him. Cursed, and thrice cursed be those who
have learned the law and the prophets, and then turn and
make light of them. Cæsar’s hordes, in their ignorance,
pay homage to their vile divinities; but the reprobate
Serenus and his followers befoul our traditions, and
abundantly deserve a resting-place in the valley of
Gehenna. But for the heavy hand of Tiberius, the
Circumcision might now purify itself, and cast out its
own dregs.</q>
</p>

<p>
At the first pause, the little Cassia again put in a plea.
</p>

<p>
<q>O my father! Saulus must be faint and weary.
The food which I have bespoken awaiteth him.</q>
</p>

<p>
The hour was not yet come for the common midday
repast; so Saulus followed her to the inner court, and
<pb n="77"/><anchor id="Pg077"/>Cassia with her own hands brought a wooden platter
upon which were some thin cakes, with honey, figs, and
olives, and a small silver amphora of wine. She watched
him with satisfaction while he partook of the frugal
repast.
</p>

<p>
<q>We have missed thee, Saulus. We wot not but something
terrible had befallen thee.</q>
</p>

<p>
Her face was childlike and tender, and she seemed
filled with gladness at his deliverance.
</p>

<p>
<q>Little one, thou art kind to think of me.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a quickening in his heart-beat, and he drew
a long breath as he gazed upon her happy smile and
dimpled cheeks. Her slight form was lithe and shapely;
her large eyes, arched by drooping lids, downcast, and
the full ripe lips, carelessly parted, seemed like those
of a child. But in the soft air of Judea, and under the
genial warmth of an Oriental sun, children, like plants,
blossom early.
</p>

<p>
<q>Saulus, thou art brave! No other man so valiantly
defendeth the religion of our fathers. Would that I had
been at the Lyceum to witness thy valor; for of all young
Hebrews, thou art the most gifted.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou dost honor me too much, little daughter of the
house of Almon! But thou art a graceful flower in the
garden of Israel.</q>
</p>

<p>
He looked into her sweet, innocent face, and reverently
took her hand, and pressed it to his lips; then quickly
turning, went out, and again passed near the frowning
Tower, upon which he cast a momentary scowl, as he
made his way up to the assembly on Mount Moriah.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of the same day, there was to be a
<pb n="78"/><anchor id="Pg078"/>meeting of the society of the <foreign rend="italic">Urim</foreign>.<note place="foot">Professor Plumptre supposes the 
<foreign rend="italic">Urim</foreign> to have been <q>a clear and
colorless stone set in the breastplate of the high priest as a symbol of light,
answering to the mystic scarab in the pectoral plate of the ancient Egyptian
priests, and that the <foreign rend="italic">Thummim</foreign> was an image corresponding to that worn
by the priestly judges of Egypt, as a symbol of truth and purity of motive.
By gazing steadfastly on these, he may have been thrown into a mysterious,
half-ecstatic state, akin to hypnotism, in which he lost all personal consciousness,
and received a spiritual illumination and insight.</q></note> This was a secret
Pharisaic organization composed of certain pupils of
Gamaliel. Some were regular lodgers at the inn, but the
larger part were dwellers in other houses. Saulus had
been chosen chief officer, and its members were his zealous
partisans. Their place of meeting was in an upper
hall in which about threescore persons could comfortably
convene. Though in an adjoining building, it could only
be entered from the inn of Almon. To reach it, it was
necessary to ascend to the roof, and pass through a long
covered passage-way, thence through a small vestibule or
anteroom.
</p>

<p>
The society designed to give Saulus a warm and befitting
reception, in acknowledgment of his valor shown
upon the day before, and to becomingly celebrate the
release of their leader from the hated Tower.
</p>

<p>
The evening arrived, and the gathering was of unwonted
interest, and the ardor uncurbed. As they passed
in, the members identified themselves, one by one, by
a certain symbolic phrase and gesture, given to the doorkeeper;
and soon the room was well filled. When all had
assembled, the doors were barred so that there could be
no intrusion from without.

<index index="pdf" level1="X. Magic and Mystery: Strange Visions"/>
<head>CHAPTER X<lb/>MAGIC AND MYSTERY: STRANGE VISIONS</head>

<p>
Magic is limited to no race, age, or condition.
Whatever the religion or ethical system of a people,
there are—underlying and intermingled—many intangible
and occult elements that are common to
humanity. Often the modern world comes into recognition
of some veiled principle or potentiality, and
marks and christens it <foreign rend="italic">de novo</foreign>, believing it to be an
original discovery. A deeper investigation, however,
reveals evidences of its power and presence, extending
backward indefinitely. Both the real mysteries
and the superstitions that prevail during successive
epochs change their form of manifestation, but a
slight excavation shows that the same psychical germs
and roots are indigenous to every soil.
</p>

<p>
The Hebrews, like other races, made research among
all that is latent and mystical in nature and man.
Although more has been written regarding the magic
and occultism of the Chaldeans, Persians, and Greeks,
yet a search in the light of the Present, through the
ancient Hebrew writings, shows them to be crowded with
accounts of psychical phenomena, though expressed in
historic terms. These were counted as supernatural,
which signified beyond the realm of law, and outside
<pb n="80"/><anchor id="Pg080"/>of the logical relation of cause and effect. This view
has continued in large degree down to the present
time. It was supposed that Jehovah was constantly
revealing himself by special volition through dreams,
visions, trances, voices, and signs; and spirits, both
good and evil, are of frequent mention. Their chronological
distance, together with a preternatural glamour
which has been cast upon them, has caused their
recorded phenomena to seem unique or special, rather
than universal. But they are intermingled with every
system of worship which the world has known.
</p>

<p>
Even the revelation of the divine has come through
inward states of consciousness rather than by outward
observation. This is its orderly method. The mind
of man is ever sounding its own hidden deeps, and
striving to bring to light its infinite wealth of fundamental
and occult mysteries. It instinctively feels that
there is a divine inlet at its profound centre.
</p>

<p>
Creative art is ever transcending the real in its search
for the coming ideal. Even Nature herself is subservient
to the mastery of Mind. A true magic is
divine; while its inversion and abuse,—sometimes
called black magic,—in the very nature of things,
kindles Tartarean pains and penalties.
</p>

<p>
Genius can never be satisfied with the world as it
is, therefore it can and must make a new one. Science
discovers and classifies; while art, which is but the
name for active human imaging, is divine in that it
creates. Next in value to a seen Utopia is one which
can be conjured into existence, and such is awaiting
every one’s command.
</p>

<pb n="81"/><anchor id="Pg081"/>

<p>
But magic, as commonly defined, is a two-edged
instrument. Misused, it becomes evil <foreign rend="italic">genii</foreign>, who summon
foul shapes, and clothe them with realism. Passions,
hates, and evil imagings in the mist of mind
sometimes become solidified embodiments that haunt
and persecute their creators. He who peers into the
raging billows of a disorderly imagination beholds
monsters into which he has breathed the breath of life.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p>
The secret society of the <foreign rend="italic">Urim</foreign> had assembled, and
the doors were closed. Their meeting-place was a remarkable
occult study, for every decoration and furnishing
possessed some mystical or symbolic significance.
In each of the four corners, upon an elevated pedestal
of white marble, stood a tall brass candelabrum of
beaten work, containing seven branches upon its shaft,
each having a lamp filled with pure olive oil for the
light, with knop and cup fashioned like an almond-blossom.
At the east end of the room there was a
heavy table of acacia wood, the top of which was
curiously engraved, and upon each corner was a horn
of one piece with it. Just over its centre, and suspended
from the ceiling by a silken cord, was a large
quartzoid of transparent rock-crystal. It was believed
that at certain seasons a steady, concentrated gaze into
its pellucid depths would produce visions, or at least
symbols of future events, and sometimes there was included
glimpses of things distant. The table was
enclosed by a curtain of blue, gold, and scarlet, held
in place by ouches or sockets attached to a finely
woven band supported by standards of beaten brass.
</p>

<pb n="82"/><anchor id="Pg082"/>

<p>
At the opposite end of the room were small wheels,
cunningly devised of dark steel mirrors, made to revolve,
section within section, mystifying and trance-producing
in their occult power, and held to be symbolic of the
wheels of the prophet Ezekiel. The walls and ceiling
were bespangled with tracings, emblematic of prophecy,
miracle, sacrifice, circumcision, and the covenants.
</p>

<p>
In the centre of the room there was a small brazen
altar, consecrated to the burning of stacte, onycha, frankincense,
and other aromatic spices. Near the entrance
stood a cabinet of olive-wood containing flagons and
bowls from which wine was served, and also platters
containing thin wheaten wafers.
</p>

<p>
The rites of the society were commonly a matter of
somewhat formal routine; but on special occasions or
anniversaries they included revels, psychic agitations,
disorderly and ungoverned excitements, trances, and enchantments.
At times the Jew, with all the weight of
the Covenant upon him, gave himself up to those things
which corresponded to the orgies of the neighboring religions.
But his excesses, though violent, were far less
gross.
</p>

<p>
With the rapid growth of sectarian bigotry among the
disciples of Gamaliel, the antagonism of the hyper-Pharisaic
faction had become exceedingly bitter. This was
embodied strongly in Saulus, as the natural leader; and
his followers were wont to glorify him without bound.
His release from the Tower through the intercession of
the Rabban, being misunderstood, greatly emboldened
them.
</p>

<p>
After the society had convened, each young Jew donned
<pb n="83"/><anchor id="Pg083"/>the insignia of the order, and appeared in his place. At
a given signal, all arose, formed in procession, and passed
slowly around the room, each in turn quaffing a small
flagon of wine, which was the opening act of formal
ceremony. After the last had been served, the column
began a stately march around a large circle, which was
symbolically marked upon the floor, falling into the
rhythm of a spirited chant dedicated to their leader, in
which all joined.
</p>

<lg>
<l><q rend="post: none">Saulus we praise,</q></l>
<l>Our defender is strong,</l>
<l>His standard we raise,</l>
<l>His days shall be long.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The Roman we dare;</l>
<l>The apostate we hate;</l>
<l>Ho! brothers, we swear</l>
<l>By Israel’s fate.</l>
</lg>
<lg>

<l>Judea will rise,</l>
<l>Her natal fires glow,</l>
<l>Her fame reach the skies:</l>
<l><q rend="pre: none">Woe be to her foe.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
At length, after the observance of an imposing ritual
according to the order of the society, the chairman, who
had been chosen for the occasion, mounted the tribune,
and made an address.
</p>

<p>
<q>Brothers of the <foreign rend="italic">Urim</foreign>! Hebrew princes of the East
and of the West, of the North and of the South!
Ward<pb n="84"/><anchor id="Pg084"/>ers of the mysteries of our noble order! We have met
to engage in the exercise of our secret rites, and also
to honor our most worthy Dictator, Saulus. O sons of
prophets! It belongeth to our brotherhood to establish
a sovereignty among the disciples of Gamaliel, and to
discomfit the destroyers of our Judean traditions, who
deceitfully continue to wear our name and covenant.
Our adversaries are near. Even the worthy Rabban
scents not their plottings, so disguised are they with
professions of good-will and liberality. The Roman is
an open foe whose courage wins respect; but they who
betray our doctrine, covenant, and circumcision are the
real enemies of the Most High and of the Chosen People.
Honor to Saulus! Guides of the Inner and Outer
Circle! Present our special guest of the night for our
welcome!</q>
</p>

<p>
Saulus was conducted with much ceremony to a seat
raised upon a dais which was canopied with an elaborate
baldachin, and which was used only upon rare and
notable occasions. A crown of laurel was placed upon
his head; and a dance in slow rhythm, which was emblematic
of laudation, was performed in a circle about
him. At length the ceremony ended, and Saulus arose
and addressed a few words to his fellow-members.
</p>

<p>
<q>Guides and guardians of the <foreign rend="italic">Urim</foreign>, and comrades!
I am thrilled by your unwonted devotion, but accept it
as a tribute to our worthy cause, which I would faithfully
serve. May the mysteries and visions of our prophetic
ritual this night be propitious!</q>
</p>

<p>
The formal exercises were ended.
</p>

<p>
Saulus lightly laid aside the laurel wreath, and
de<pb n="85"/><anchor id="Pg085"/>scended to the midst of his fellows. The members of
the Outer Circle then withdrew; while those of the Inner,
among whom was Saulus, remained to seek for signs
and wonders.<note place="foot"><p>It is probable that no race—whatever its religion—ever existed, among
which there were not some who craved mystical and psychical developments,
and who often carried them to excess. Temperaments of ardent and imaginative
quality are swayed with an overpowering desire to delve into the
future and unseen. We may well suppose that the Rabban would have disapproved
of the excesses of this society had he been aware of them; but
what teacher, ancient or modern, was ever able to curb and control, or even
to find out, the devices of his youthful students?
</p>

<p>
It is well known that crystal-gazing and some other mechanical expedients,
under certain conditions, produce hypnosis, clairvoyance, visions,
trances, and other unusual and abnormal psychical phenomena. In many
cases they seem to include truthful hints and foregleams of future events or
distant scenes. Like attracts like, and sometimes gives it symbolic embodiment.
An objective vision may come from subjective roots, and its
creations often haunt the consciousness.</p></note>
</p>

<p>
After the doors were rebarred, a flame was lighted
upon the small brazen altar, and aromatic spices were
placed upon it for slow consumption. The members
then seated themselves around it, with hands joined, and
remained silent for some time, breathing in deep, concerted,
rhythmical measure. A pungent but fascinating
odor gradually filled the room, and a charmed exhilaration
stole by degrees upon the minds and senses of the
brotherhood of the Inner Circle. A subtle enchantment,
delightful in quality, transported them to empyrean
heights of consciousness, so that the every-day world of
objective events receded and became distant and misty.
They craved some prophetic symbolism of the future.
</p>

<p>
After a short sitting they arose, and four of the number,
Saulus being one, passed to the acacia table, where
<pb n="86"/><anchor id="Pg086"/>they seated themselves, each grasping one of its horns,
and turning a fixed gaze into the transparent deeps of
the great crystal which hung in their midst. The others
seated themselves in a semicircle facing the revolving
wheel of mirrors, and yielded passively to such impressions
as might float in upon them. Soon there was a
change, a peculiar abstraction being apparent.
</p>

<p>
For a full hour a delicious ecstatic consciousness prevailed,
and perfect silence reigned. The room seemed
like a bower of roses. Fruits were heaped in golden
baskets, and fine sprays of perfumed water from invisible
fountains filled the air. Jasper floors stretched away in
the distance, and upon them were spread mats of shining
crystals of variegated hues. Life, action, color, and
warmth pervaded the atmosphere so thickly that one
could float in their shimmering wavelets. Reverberations
of unearthly music flowed gently in, as if a myriad
of Æolian harps were hung above, below, and on all
sides, which were swept by heavenly breezes. The energies
of Nature were melted into an impalpable but all-embracing
voluptuous harmony.
</p>

<p>
But at length there were symptoms of discord, and a
gradual transformation began to be manifest. Harshness
and disorder slowly emerged in uncanny shapes
from the dim background. The psychical intoxication
which prevailed was perceptibly embittered, and subtle
forms of mysterious portent crept in. The ambient air
became streaked with dark patches which grew thicker
and wider. The night-winds sprang up, and muffled
mutterings from without were borne in with sullen discordance.
The erstwhile film of iridescence shrivelled
<pb n="87"/><anchor id="Pg087"/>and parted, and flitting out from behind were grim faces
of sin and crime, anon hiding behind clouds of blackness.
The blood-streaked moon that had arisen in a
brazen sky poured forth a flood of wan, sickly light which
entered the casement and seemed offensive. The vapors
that ascended from the altar were resolved into a semblance
of moving figures of dark and gloomy mien, with
hollow and gusty voices, and eyeballs which glowed like
living coals. Suddenly a bluish flash filled the room,
and upon the walls letters of fire were traced without
the aid of mortal hand. Then it seemed as though the
room were fissured and rent by a strange and resistless
pressure from without. Deep, jarring sounds rumbled
below like the mad bellowing of an unborn earthquake.
The black shadow of a Great Hand moved slowly across
the ceiling.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 8"/>

<p>
A living Shape emerged through the wall, and seated
itself in the chair upon the dais which Saulus before had
occupied. It was thickly veiled, and appeared more like
some misshapen reptile than a human form. Its intolerable
eyes looked out with an appalling stare of hate and
mockery. It was a nameless Horror, with an aspect of
deadly malignity, and a wreath of fire, shaped like the
laurel chaplet that Saulus had worn, was upon its head.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 8"/>

<p>
A crackling explosion! Then passing directly through
the barred door, a procession of foul dancing figures
entered in pairs, and tripped lightly around the larger
mystic circle which was marked upon the floor. Hatred
<pb n="88"/><anchor id="Pg088"/>and Revenge led the way, each with his name in letters
of flame upon his forehead. Treachery and Conspiracy
followed, arm in arm, and next, Persecution and Slaughter,
with a host of lesser imps bringing up the rear.
They wheeled about, and with ever-quickening step, each
in turn bowed to the Nameless One who occupied the
chair upon the dais. Another blinding crash! and the
whole scene was dissolved into the blackness of darkness.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 8"/>

<p>
Every member of the Inner Circle was suddenly awakened
from a heavy sleep. The lamps had been extinguished,
and the flame upon the altar had expired. The
lights were soon rekindled, and everything was found as
had been wont. The ashy pallor and cold perspiration
which was upon every face gradually passed away, and
courage and calmness resumed their sway. Each had
dreamed a dream of delicious enchantment, followed by
a visit to the Tartarean regions, but no two saw them
quite alike.
</p>

<p>
The chairman of the session, with a bewildered look,
turned to Saulus.
</p>

<p>
<q>Most worthy Dictator! Perchance thou canst interpret
the mystery of these unwonted visions?</q>
</p>

<p>
A shade of perplexity passed over the face of the son
of Benoni; but after a brief wavering he replied,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Comrades of the <foreign rend="italic">Urim</foreign>! Awake and arise! The
signs are propitious! It hath ever been so, even in the
days of the patriarchs and prophets. The chosen and
righteous call out burning enmity, which is made known
through ghostly and malignant shapes. We must
exor<pb n="89"/><anchor id="Pg089"/>cise the unhallowed Phantom which would thrust itself
into our Covenant and Tradition. Brothers of the
Inner Circle! we incarnated the spirit of prophecy, and
must needs look upon the ghostly symbolic visions of
warfare. They crowd themselves upon us as mystical
revealers of those who wickedly betray the doctrine of
Israel. Only by glimpses of such shades of Tophet
could we be forewarned. They are sent to fire us with
a holy zeal in overcoming the false-hearted. The vengeance
of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob waxes
against all who burn strange fire upon our sacred altars;
and we must needs have signs of their abomination
brought before our eyes.</q>
</p>

<p>
The comrades of Saulus were reassured by his eloquence,
and his interpretation found favor.
</p>

<p>
<q>Victor Serenus is the arch adversary,</q> cried one.
</p>

<p>
<q>The hand that smiteth him shall be blessed,</q> added
another.
</p>

<p>
<q>He deceiveth the disciples of the Rabban, and is not
worthy to live,</q> cried a third, and there was a mingling
of voices.
</p>

<p>
<q>Woe to Serenus!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Spoil his house!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To Gehenna with him!</q>
</p>

<p>
Saulus waved his hand for silence, and then said, with
a violent gesture,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Comrades of the <foreign rend="italic">Urim</foreign>! If ye will, ye may smite
him before the cock-crowing, for the Lord regardeth him
not.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a general clamor to be led against the
apostate.
</p>

<pb n="90"/><anchor id="Pg090"/>

<p>
<q>Members of the Inner Circle! I wot we may take
him unawares while darkness is still over the Holy
City.</q>
</p>

<p>
After further taking counsel together, all descended to
the street, and made their way through a narrow lane to a
place beyond Hezekiah’s Pool, which was near the house
where Serenus lived with his mother. Though within
the city walls, the locality was remote and lonely.
Arming themselves with stones as they passed along,
Saulus commanded that, when they arrived at the house,
they should surround it and make some outcry. Serenus
would then appear, when they could smite him,
and flee in the darkness, with none to witness against
them.
</p>

<p>
<q>He shall lick the dust like a serpent,</q> said Saulus;
<q>yea, as the Lord liveth, he shall fall and not rise
again.</q>
</p>

<p>
All then joined hands in a small circle, and made a
solemn vow of secrecy and service.
</p>

<p>
<q>By the stones of the Holy City, we swear that the
God of Israel shall accomplish his fury and pour out his
fierce anger, through us, his chosen servants, for we do
his bidding.</q>
</p>

<p>
Unclasping hands, they again gathered up the stones
which they had laid down during the ceremony, and
made their way to the house.
</p>

<p>
The moon had gone down, and the first flush of dawn
was faintly visible over the eastern mountains. A sullen
chill pervaded the air, and the boundless Impalpable
which surrounds the earth seemed filled with a life which
needs not breath. Nature was in a mood of gloom and
<pb n="91"/><anchor id="Pg091"/>distemper. The very leaves of the trees, invisible in the
darkness, rustled a chorus of Sibylline sighs and hisses;
but the comrades heard and saw nothing.
</p>

<p>
At a given signal an outcry was made, and Serenus
looked down from a window to make inquiry concerning
it.
</p>

<p>
<q>What would ye? Doth a stranger need succor?</q>
</p>

<p>
Straightway a volley of stones were hurled at him;
but as it was yet dark, Serenus suffered no harm, though
they fell thick about him. But one glanced, and falling,
struck Saulus full in the forehead, and he fell down as if
he had yielded up the ghost. Those who were near
lifted him up and quickly bore him away.

<q rend="post: none">Know, O father of my friend, that I have to acquaint
thee with a terrible event. Last night, as Saulus and
some fellow-disciples of Gamaliel were walking in one
of the by-ways of the Holy City, he was badly wounded
by a stone which was cast by some unknown hand. It
struck him in the forehead, and, O father of an illustrious
son, he yet lingereth between life and death. His
companions could not well convince themselves whether
an enemy or a robber committed the shameful deed.
Among the disciples of the Rabban, there is one, Victor
Serenus, a wicked apostate, and we wot not but he may
be the malefactor. O venerated Benoni! I have pity in
my heart for thee and thy renowned son. For many
hours after he was borne back to our inn he lay as one
dead; but, the God of Israel be praised, his life is still
<pb n="93"/><anchor id="Pg093"/>within him, and now he hath opened his eyes. We shall
tenderly minister to thy noble scion, who is held in such
favor, and a physician hath faithfully bound up his
wounds with a healing balm.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Thou art blessed among men to have a son who possesseth
such goodness and power. The Rabban esteemeth

he hath much reputation as the defender of all our sacred

it will rejoice thy heart to receive testimony that I hold

I keep all the fasts of the week, and do not forget the
three prayers of the day or the visits to the Holy Temple.
Neither am I unmindful, O kinsfolk, of all careful ablutions,
that I may be free from ceremonial uncleanness.
As a Pharisee of the Pharisees, I strive to keep the
whole law, and not offend in one point. In good conscience
I have respect unto all the commands of the law
of Moses, and scrupulously observe all the decisions,
Sabbatic rules, and prescriptions. To the Rabbinical
principles of exegesis, and the whole code of legislation
recorded in the Pentateuch, I have given much heed, and
trust that I am not found wanting.</q>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">There hath appeared among the disciples of Gamaliel
some who make a small matter of our holy rites in
synagogues and in the Temple, and, though Jews after
the flesh, they lightly observe our traditions. They set
forth somewhat of the Greek and Alexandrian philosophies,
affirming that God is the God of the Gentiles, the
same as of the Hebrews. They vainly boast that his
presence ministers to their life and health, and that his
mercy is over all men, while they profanely say that the
Circumcision is of no avail. So idolatrous are they that
they profess to find their God everywhere. They would
<pb n="99"/><anchor id="Pg099"/>fain blaspheme the Holy of Holies by proclaiming that
he is as much in the groves and fields as in the Temple.
These are sons of Jews of the Dispersion, who have been
seduced by some of the heresies of the heathen with
whom they have had concourse. They vaunt themselves
of their wisdom, while they respect not the Law and
Covenant.</q>

and the sojourn in Egypt, to the tribe of Benjamin
and our father Abraham. Thou hast instructed me—and
my discipleship with the Rabban hath confirmed
it—that especial wisdom hath descended through all

<p>
Late in the afternoon of a warm day in early autumn,
the softened glow of the descending sun fell into the
spacious court of one of the notable palaces of the Holy
City. In the centre, the spray from a small fountain
curved gracefully into a quadrangular marble basin; and
ranged immediately around it were pots, partly hidden
by moist mosses, which contained lilies, anemonies, irises
of iridescent hue, violets, and jasmine, all freshened by
the neighboring dampness. The surrounding pavement
was of graceful mosaic design; and the prevailing air of
coolness, cleanliness, and repose was in marked contrast
with the dry, brassy atmosphere outside. Porches, supported
by slim, lightly carved columns, extended entirely
around both stories of the court; and these, in certain
parts where the sun’s rays might penetrate, were shaded
by hanging portières woven of fine goat’s hair in striped
design. At either end, a stairway of marble steps led to
the upper terrace, and still another flight to a valve
which opened upon the roof. On one side was a broad
portal which led into a great library, where shelves and
<pb n="103"/><anchor id="Pg103"/>drawers were filled with thousands of rolls of manuscripts
and inscribed parchments, each neatly tied, labelled, and
classified. The place seemed fragrant with all the subtile
richness of Hebrew law, prophecy, and poetry, which
had been stored up from the accumulated wisdom of a
long line of ancient seers, sages, and poets. All the
carvings, friezes, and appurtenances of the court were
also symbolically eloquent with the lore of Israel.
</p>

<p>
The tinkling of the fountain sounded pleasantly to the
ears of two persons that were comfortably seated near it,
who had sought the spacious openness of the court in
preference to the library. An earnest conversation was
in progress. The palace was that of Gamaliel; and the
elder of the two, a tall, dignified man, with silvered hair
and long, flowing beard, was the noted Rabban himself.
Beneath the folds of his turban of snowy whiteness shone
out his brilliant but kindly eyes; and his mien, while
dignified, was warm and gracious. The other was Serenus,
and it was evident that the two were upon terms
of free and friendly familiarity.
</p>

<p>
<q>Reverend and worthy master! I count myself happy
to have this opportunity to open my heart to thee.
Things have made themselves manifest to me which
greatly concern our race and religion, and, peradventure,
the Gentiles also. Dost thou not, noble teacher, discern
in certain signs of the times the fulfilment of prophecy
and a new dispensation of righteousness?</q>
</p>

<p>
The Rabban turned his face toward his young disciple
with an expression of curious but friendly interest.
</p>

<p>
<q>My son! Many strange and notable things have
come to pass in this generation, and it behooveth us to
<pb n="104"/><anchor id="Pg104"/>interpret them in a wise and prudent manner. I wot not
what thou hast in mind, but have pleasure in thy presence,
and desire that thou shouldst acquaint me fully
with that which is in thine heart.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Before speaking of certain matters of our religion,</q>
said Serenus, <q>I would inquire if it be known unto thee
that Saulus is again in the Holy City.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Dost thou make reference to the young Hebrew from
Tarsus, of such fiery zeal, who was aforetime my disciple?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is no other than he! Several passovers have
passed since he went back to his native city to learn a
trade, after the manner of our custom, and he hath abated
none of the vehemence of his former life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It now cometh to my remembrance how he and a
band of his comrades set upon thee in the Lyceum, for
which he was taken to the Tower by a centurion, and at
thy intercession I persuaded his release. Knowest thou,
hath he still the same mind?</q>
</p>

<p>
The events of a few years past coursed in quick succession
through the memory of the young Hellenist, but
he was not stirred by them.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay! It hath come to pass that his persecution is
now turned toward the followers of the prophet of Nazareth.
It is noised abroad that straightway upon his
return to Jerusalem, and since, he hath ceased not night
or day to vex them sorely. He hath almost persuaded
the Sanhedrin to give him authority to destroy them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hath he, then, forgotten his enmity toward thee, my
young disciple?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wot not fully, but am so persuaded. His exceeding
<pb n="105"/><anchor id="Pg105"/>wrath against the new sect of the Nazarene, peradventure,
hath swallowed up his former enmity; and who knoweth,
also, but it hath come to his ears that thou hast since
made me thine helper, wherefore he might be more
prudent.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He that waxeth wroth worketh out his own destruction,</q>
uttered the Rabban in a rather reserved and oracular
manner. <q>But what of the request of thine heart,
which thou desirest to make known unto me?</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus paused for a moment before making answer,
for something seemed to stir him from the depths of his
soul. He looked gravely but tenderly into the face of
his master. He felt that a great crisis in his own life
had come, which could not longer be put off. The accumulated
forces of years, long pent up, had gradually
gathered momentum until they must find utterance.
</p>

<p>
<q>Most worthy master! What thinkest <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> of the
prophet of Nazareth who was crucified?</q>
</p>

<p>
The wise and venerable Gamaliel was astounded at
the gravity and earnestness of his favorite assistant in
making an inquiry which seemed of such trivial importance.
He toyed with the long fringe of his robe for a
moment, and cast an inquiring glance into the face of
Serenus as if to divine his meaning. It hardly occurred
to him that his most eminent follower, aforetime promoted
to be his assistant, could have any sympathy, or
even remote interest, in the feeble faction of the Galilean;
but the question demanded an answer.
</p>

<p>
<q>My young disciple! Thy question is of small concern
to me, neither doth it matter to thee. Thou shouldst
be aware that while I counted the Nazarene to be a
<pb n="106"/><anchor id="Pg106"/>deceiver, I would that he had not been evil entreated and
put to death. Peradventure he was self-deceived; but
however that may be, had he been let alone, his works
would have come to an end, and his followers become
scattered. But what have we to do with him? It is all
of the past and concerneth us not.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I give honor unto thy wisdom, O learned master! but
I am persuaded that the Nazarene was a righteous man
and a great prophet; yea, such as the world hath not
known. Thou knowest that I was born a Jew, and have
respect unto the fulfilling of the law; but the doctrines
of the Pharisees have become vain, and I can no longer
bear their burden. The commandment of God hath
given place to the traditions of men. The faith of our
father Abraham, the testimonies of Moses, and the words
of the holy prophets, have become of none effect; for this
generation hath given itself over to washings of cups
and pots and brazen vessels, to fastings and ceremonial
oblations. Behold, the letter of the law hath altogether
brought its life to destruction!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, O Serenus! how doth these things concern
the doctrine of the Nazarene? I am somewhat like-minded
with thee concerning the traditions of this generation.
The dead observances of the extreme sect of
the Pharisees have become an occasion of vanity, and a
stumbling-block, and must needs be purified. Let us
set about to reprove these things, and teach a restitution
of the Law as handed down to Moses. But I beseech
thee! go not after this new sect of strange faith, for its
teaching will surely come to naught.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I owe thee respect, O worthy Gamaliel! but am
<pb n="107"/><anchor id="Pg107"/>fully persuaded in this matter, and now declare unto
thee that from this day henceforth I wash my hands of
the traditions of the elders! It hath come more and
more to me that our holy religion is corrupted and
wormeaten, and that it altogether concerneth itself with
polishing the outside of the platter. It is a valley of
dry bones, like that spoken of by Ezekiel the prophet,
and only an anointing of the Spirit, which hath been so
perfectly manifested through Jesus of Nazareth, can
awaken them to life, and clothe them with flesh.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I marvel and am sorrowful, O my young disciple!
that thou hast been led away by this new heresy. I
know thee to be upright in spirit; but, if thou art persuaded
in this way, behold, thou wilt cut thyself off from
thy people, and from thy place of honor in the school
of the prophets. The Nazarene, of whom thou speakest,
was reputed to be an unlearned man, the son of a carpenter!
If he had knowledge, whence came it? If I
have learned rightly, he even vaunted himself as the
Lord’s anointed, the fulfiller of prophecy, and the deliverer
of Israel! What empty boasting! He, a Galilean
of no reputation, whose followers were only ignorant
fishermen and publicans! <hi rend="italic">he</hi> to deliver Israel from her
oppressors! <hi rend="italic">he</hi> to build up the waste places of Jerusalem,
and establish her dominion forever! Seest thou not, O
Serenus! that this is altogether vanity? If he were to
have been the Restorer of our people, thinkest thou that
he would have suffered himself to be persecuted, condemned,
and crucified? I say unto thee nay!</q>
</p>

<p>
The young man looked searchingly into the face of the
Rabban, but with unwonted calmness.
</p>

<pb n="108"/><anchor id="Pg108"/>

<p>
<q>I beseech thee to listen to me yet farther, O teacher
of Israel! for I am fully persuaded that the word of the
Lord hath quickened my heart. Our fathers and this
generation have greatly erred, touching the Messias, in
what hath been spoken by the ancient prophets. I call
thee to witness! What saith Isaiah, the son of Amoz,
than whom there hath not been a greater? Doth he not
prophesy of humility, and reproach, and travail, and persecution?
Nay! Saith he not that his righteous servant
shall pour out his soul unto death? Hath it not
now come to pass that he was despised and rejected of
men, and that his report hath not been believed? Did
not Daniel, of the royal family of Judah, prophesy of the
stone which was cut out of the mountain without hands,
which brake in pieces the mighty image whose brightness
was excellent? Behold this when interpreted! Doth it
not signify that the kingdoms of this world are to fall,
and the eternal kingdom of righteousness be set up in
their place, which shall grow and fill the whole earth?</q>
</p>

<p>
An expression of astonishment and restlessness swept
over the features of the venerable Rabban. Could the
young disciple teach the famous head of the school of
Hillel?
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou hast waxed zealous, young man, in the defence
of thy strange doctrines! I pray thee, who hath persuaded
thee of these things, and that the Book of Prophecies
hath aught concerning the Nazarene?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have it not upon the authority of any man, but the
Spirit within witnesseth with my spirit that these things
are true. The kingdom of which the Nazarene hath laid
the corner-stone is a dominion which is to increase and
<pb n="109"/><anchor id="Pg109"/>wax great, and pertaineth not only to the Jews, but to
all peoples. All are children of God, but no one save
him hath yet perfected the fruit whose seed lieth within.
His law is more complete than that of Moses; for he
hath summed it up as love to God and all men, with
the whole heart. Herein behold, as in a glass, all the
law and the prophets! Moreover, he wrought many
signs and wonders, and miracles of healing, such being
a witness of his full possession by the Father, which is
the Spirit of Truth. But he declared that all things that
he made manifest are possible to his faithful followers,
and even that greater works may yet be shown forth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Serenus! I marvel at the unwonted things thou believest!
I bewail that thou art deceived! From whence
hast thou these tidings of him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have had converse with some of his worthy but
despised disciples, and know whereof I speak. Moreover,
their works testify concerning them, and show forth
the power of God working in and through man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou hast indeed become altogether unmindful that
the salvation of the God of Israel cometh only through
the Covenant with the Chosen People. But what sayest
thou? It hath come to my ears that the disciples of the
Nazarene still walk in the ordinances, except, peradventure,
one young zealot, named Stephanos, who disputeth
in the synagogues, and stirreth up some contention. But
be thou warned! Thy Galilean prophet proclaimed himself
as Messias, and the deliverer of Israel! What sayest
thou? Is not this blasphemy?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay. He claimeth not sole possession of sonship,
but declared that the anointing is for all sons of God;
<pb n="110"/><anchor id="Pg110"/>but it appeareth that he only hath yet emptied himself
of all else, and manifested the spiritual image in fulness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O Serenus! thou hast been deceived by false witnesses,
and therefore makest the doctrine of Jehovah
common and unclean! Hast thou forgotten that the
Gentiles and they that worship other gods are the enemies
of the Most High?</q>
</p>

<p>
The calm dignity of Serenus was unmoved, and his
face almost shone with an inner light which seemed to
fill him.
</p>

<p>
<q>The God of all the earth hath no enemies, whether
Jew or Gentile. He cannot know enmity; for it is not,
save in the hearts of such as separate themselves from
him. They dwell in the darkness which they only have
made by their own vain and base imaginings.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It grieveth me, O my young disciple! to know that
thou hast become faithless to the religion of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob. Thou art altogether mistaken in the
anointed one of Israel. When Messias cometh he will
be King, Priest, and Prophet. First of all, he will deliver
his people from their enemies, and set up a throne,
and then reign righteously. The Gentiles will have no
part in this dominion. They serve false gods; and the
Most High will destroy them, root and branch. Then
shall the seed of Abraham inherit the earth! Thou art
pure in spirit, but no longer a son of Israel. Thy connection
with the school of Hebrew prophets, after the
order of Hillel, is ended.</q>

The world looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical
equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself. Take what
figure you will, its exact value, not more, nor less, still returns to
you. Every secret is told, every crime is punished, every virtue rewarded,
every wrong redressed, in silence and certainty. What we
call retribution is the universal necessity by which the whole appears
wherever a part appears.—<hi rend="smallcaps">Emerson.</hi>
</p>
</epigraph>

<p>
The sun was drinking up the morning dew which
rested lightly upon the reeds, grasses, and climbing
vines that thinly fringed the steeps and cliffs of the
hill-country of Mount Ephraim, a little to the northwest
of Jerusalem. Through this broken district, the
road which led from the seaport of Cæsarea to the
Holy City wound along near the bottom of a shallow
wady, and ere long between scarred bluffs through a
long, irregular valley, and then ascended, leading over
a considerable elevation before passing through the
Mount Ephraim gate into the city.
</p>

<p>
In these early morning hours, a small caravan might
be seen, winding along the beaten track in slow, serpentine
fashion. It was composed of a few well-laden
camels and asses, accompanied by men, women, and
children, who, having just struck their tents, were now
nearing the end of their journey. An eager air of
<pb n="112"/><anchor id="Pg112"/>anticipation and unwonted interest was visible in the
little company; and the brightness of the morning, and
the near approach to the Capital, infused every one with
new life, in view of what was soon to open to their
vision.
</p>

<p>
What a tale this road might unfold of the various
companies of pilgrims, princes, captains, and panoplied
armies, which, before and since, have trod its
tortuous windings! What victories and defeats, what
surprises and disappointments, what inspiration and
suffering! What vain hopes destroyed and heroism rewarded!
What eruptions of invaders, who at intervals
have despoiled the ancient city,—Chaldeans, Assyrians,
Romans, and later the great armies of Rome under
Titus; and long afterwards, Turks and crusaders, like
great tidal waves, have surged through this and the
other beaten highways that converge in the city of
Mount Zion.
</p>

<p>
In the little procession were some who for the first
time were to have a vision of the Temple, the city’s
long, curving, battlemented walls, its proud palaces, its
frowning towers, its graceful cenotaphs and pillared
courts, and others to whose eyes all these were familiar.
Within two or three furlongs of the city wall on the
northwest, the road passes over a considerable elevation,
from which Jerusalem lies spread out upon its
native hills, with the bluish-purple slopes of the Mount
of Olives in the background to the southeast. On this
high ground the road skirted a large open garden, or
park, that sloped toward the city, which contained seats,
arbors, flowers, and shrubbery, the whole forming a
<pb n="113"/><anchor id="Pg113"/>place of public resort. Interspersed by small trees, and
shaded by bushes and vines, were a series of graded
terraces, each of which commanded a fine view of the
city. It was a favorite resort in the milder seasons of
the year.
</p>

<p>
The caravan passed on through the gateway into the
city; but a young man, somewhat below medium size,
with strongly marked Jewish features, left it, and turning
to the right, entered the garden to enjoy the prospect,
and call up a few reminiscences before the final
completion of his journey.
</p>

<p>
It was no other than Saulus!
</p>

<p>
After an absence of a few years in his native city,
he was again near the scene of his more youthful education
and adventures. The sun was already warm; and,
wiping the perspiration from his forehead, he sat down
in a small arbor, which was covered overhead, and
partly sheltered before and behind by hedges and hanging
vines. The fragrance of many blossoms loaded the
morning air, and the cheery song of birds echoed from
the trees far and near.
</p>

<p>
As Saulus looked out over the familiar landmarks of
the city, his bosom heaved, his cheeks reddened, and
his eyes dilated at the panorama that was again unrolled
before him. His thoughts ran quickly back
over the long history of the Chosen People, their many
trials and conquests, their glory and their captivity.
There was much to inspire, but more to sadden. What
a history of numberless vicissitudes was written in
stone, masonry, and marble! How many conflicts,
successes, and disasters were wrapped up in the
mas<pb n="114"/><anchor id="Pg114"/>sive city wall built by good King Hezekiah! What
a long line of events were cast into the haughty Towers
of Hippicus, Phasælus, and Mariamne, whose proud
heads lifted themselves high into the air directly to the
southward! Still beyond, in the same direction, the
royal hill of Mount Zion was crowned by the great
Herodian palace. What a long line of fragrant memories
of patriarchs and judges, of anointed kings, including
David and Solomon, covering many bright days of
Hebrew history, were there solidified into visible form!
Upon the same historic site stood the house of Caiaphas,
the Roman prætorium, and the great central synagogue.
</p>

<p>
Was the time coming when the proud Roman would
be thrust out, and Jewish dominion again centre with
undimmed lustre upon these consecrated heights? How
long, oh, how long! before the God of Israel would rally
and inspire the multitudes of his people, bring back
his scattered captives, and lead them forth, a conquering
host?
</p>

<p>
Farther to the east, and directly above the great massive
Tower of Antonia,—which Saulus recognized with
a frown,—the sacred Temple-crowned summit of Moriah
caused a throb of rejoicing and patriotic pride. His
eye rested with satisfaction upon the great pile of snowy
whiteness, founded by Solomon, and rebuilt by Herod,
with its long lines of marble pillars, gates of Corinthian
brass, and numerous towers and pinnacles overlaid with
silver and gold. How many courts, each encircling
others within, lifted themselves, tier above tier, to the
Tabernacle and Holy of Holies, which formed the sacred
<pb n="115"/><anchor id="Pg115"/>centre from which Jehovah radiated his glory in a special
and peculiar manner.
</p>

<p>
The sun ascended higher, and the whole scene melted
into a dream of shimmering whiteness and beauty.
What an attraction and inspiration to every Jew in all
ages! Fitting type to him of all that is patriotic, glorious,
and heavenly! The soft green western slopes of
Olivet formed a peaceful and refreshing background to
the busy haunts of men.
</p>

<p>
Such were some of the thoughts that passed in a trooping
procession through the mind of Saulus; and now,
what of the present and future? What of his own duties,
hopes, dreams, and ambitions? What of the new heretical
sect, whose overthrow was to be his especial business
and gratification? What of the Rabban, his former companions,
Serenus, the people at the inn? Last, but far,
oh, far from least, what of Cassia?
</p>

<p>
<q>O Cassia! little one! Will thy heart beat quickly,
thy cheeks flush, and thine eyes glisten at my coming?
Hast thou dreams of my arrival, and hath absence endeared
me to thee? Hast thou often thought of him to
whom thou so faithfully and tenderly ministered? Thy
messages seem not to have been so warm and frequent
of late. Surely thou hast not lost the image of Saulus
from thy heart?</q>
</p>

<p>
The young man was suddenly aroused from his prolonged
revery by the approach of a party of men, women,
and children from the city. Some were laden with
small baskets and wallets containing wheaten wafers,
and others carried fruits, and skins of wine. It was a
pleasure excursion of Hebrew families for relaxation and
<pb n="116"/><anchor id="Pg116"/>enjoyment. They distributed themselves promiscuously
in groups among the shady and secluded seats and
arbors, dispersing in little parties, often of two or three,
in the most informal manner.
</p>

<p>
Almost before Saulus was aware of it, a young man
and woman had seated themselves immediately in front,
their backs almost hidden by a light hedge which was
covered by running vines. Their seats were very near.
His first impulse was to retire, but that was impossible
without observation; and during a moment’s hesitation
he heard something of remarkable interest. A word distinctly
uttered chained him to the spot. His position
was such that he plainly saw the backs of the young
pair, just in front and below him, through the interstices
of the hedge, while he was entirely concealed. He was
no eavesdropper, but fate transfixed him.
</p>

<p>
<q>O my little Cassia! What a delightful place! What
sayest thou? Shall we not sit down and enjoy the prospect?
Our friends seem to have scattered, and left us to
care for ourselves.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Which we are very well able to do, Barnabas. One
might sit here and dream over the Holy City.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou speakest truly, Cassia! Dreams and visions
pertain not alone to sleep and night. Thinkest
thou not that a large part of life is unfolded through
them?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My wakeful visions are very real to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, Cassia, thou judgest rightly! Day-dreams are
often true prophecies of the future. The Greek philosophy,
of which I learned something while at the feet
of Gamaliel, teacheth that our dreams of the future are
<pb n="117"/><anchor id="Pg117"/>like patterns, and that as we hold them before our gaze,
day by day, the things we shape in our own minds really
come about, and more, that we unconsciously grow into
their image. In other words, they take such hold that
we are slowly transformed by them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is such a doctrine peculiar to the Greeks? Do we
not all have visions by day as well as night? And do
they not prophesy, and even promise much? Nothing
would tempt me to part with the pictures of the future
that I carry with me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, little Cassia! Are they, then, so precious to
thee? Wilt thou give me some hint of what they promise?
I pray thee, canst thou not lend me a share in
them?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Peradventure they cannot be divided.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But at least they may be sketched in outline, if not
shared. Wilt thou not interpret for me the brightest
vision that comes to thee?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How can I?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Peradventure I can divine it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Peradventure thou canst not.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Knowest thou not, Cassia, that there are some who
say they can read the thoughts of their neighbor, much
as they would an unrolled parchment?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Claimest thou such power for thyself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I answer thee not as to my claim. But wilt thou that
I try to be thy interpreter?</q>
</p>

<p>
Cassia cast a curious but shy glance at her companion,
who seemed much absorbed in the distant mountain
slopes.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea; if thou wilt essay to play the part of a seer,
<pb n="118"/><anchor id="Pg118"/>and prophesy of my future, I will listen. I would try
thy powers.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is not so much thy future, as thy thought of thy
future, that I would divine just now,</q> said Barnabas,
with a half-hidden smile. <q>Wilt thou tell me if I interpret
rightly?</q>
</p>

<p>
She again turned a searching glance toward his face,
but his gaze was still fastened upon the mountain landscape.
</p>

<p>
<q>Peradventure yea, and peradventure nay,</q> she replied,
with a light flush; <q>but please proceed.</q>
</p>

<p>
Barnabas bade adieu to the distant mountain, and with
some vigor of manner turned his face toward the maiden
as if to read her thoughts.
</p>

<p>
<q>Almon, thy father, hath told me that Saulus is soon
to return for a season to the Holy City, and will sojourn
at the inn of the Sheepmarket. Nay, more! that he may
arrive at any hour. Behold thy bright vision!</q>
</p>

<p>
The figure just beyond the hedge gave such a start
that only the vital interest of the twain in the topic of
their conversation prevented a discovery.
</p>

<p>
Little Cassia, who was not greatly disconcerted, pouted
her lips a bit, toyed with her fan, and took her turn in
gazing at the mountain.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Barnabas! I would counsel thee, that thou set
not up for an interpreter. Seership is not befitting to
thee.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou dost say neither yea nor nay.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I say that thou hast altogether missed thy calling.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It seemeth strange; but verily, I find much contentment
in my error, if my interpretation be not true.</q>
</p>

<pb n="119"/><anchor id="Pg119"/>

<p>
<q>It hath been told me by my father that Saulus is to
return to Jerusalem, in order that he may vex the new
pestilent sect of heretics, which is said to be gathering
strength. I wot not more of his sojourn or plans.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I say unto thee again, that it rejoiceth me that my
seership be at fault.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>True prophets are not usually so fickle.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a slight tinge of cheery, though defiant, sarcasm
in her tone, and the flush on her cheek had heightened.
Then a little period of silence followed, during
which Barnabas again gave himself to the mountain. On
the other side of the thin hedge a heart was beating so
loudly that its throbs were almost audible.
</p>

<p>
At length Barnabas turned, and gently picked up the
little hand which was temptingly near, and raising it,
touched it to his lips, and as reverently lowered it, after
which it was slowly withdrawn.
</p>

<p>
<q>O my little Cassia! I again take up my seership!
I have a bright new dream of the future! our future—share
and share. I am inspired by a love, sweet, irresistible,
and endless. The vision shows me that thine is
the soul that responds, and thy heart the one that beats
in unison. I love thee with every drop of my blood, and
every thought that stirs my being. We shall know happiness,
peace, and devotion. Cassia, dear! I now proclaim
seership for thee! Behold now this bright vision
with me!</q>
</p>

<p>
Gently his arm found its way around her slender form,
and there was no actual resistance. She was so near
that her warm breath fell upon his cheek.
</p>

<p>
The pent-up forces in the soul that had been forced to
<pb n="120"/><anchor id="Pg120"/>listen burst forth in an involuntary groan; and this,
with a sudden shaking of the hedge, startled the twain,
when, at a glance, feeling the presence of a stranger
near, they turned quickly down the nearest pathway, and
rejoined their friends. The stranger, who was a stranger
still to them, was left to his own devices.

<p>
The shadows deepened, and were fast chasing away
the brightness which had streamed down from above, in
the luxurious court of the palace of Gamaliel. The interview
between the Rabban and his disciple was at an
end, and their long-standing relation fully and finally
severed. Neither evinced any disposition to reconsider
the decision, or question its wisdom.
</p>

<p>
<q>O most worthy Rabban! I have had much honor,
and thank thee for thy manifold goodness in the days
which are past. Though I go out from thy presence, my
respect will abide. Peace be with thee and thine!</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus had arisen from his seat to take leave of his
esteemed teacher and master. The young man’s bearing,
while calm and dignified, betokened a warmth of
affection which was deep and sincere. Strong ties were
being severed; but, in the nature of the case, there was
no alternative. But the perfect serenity and uncomplaining
spirit shown by the young man at their parting
touched a tender chord in the heart of Gamaliel. His
<pb n="122"/><anchor id="Pg122"/>official sternness melted away; and the warm, native gentleness
of his nature burst the barriers of his reserve.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay for a little time, Serenus, I pray thee! I cannot
let thee depart without some farther assurance of my
good-will. Forgive me for the stern decision which pertaineth
to my office, for it grieveth me to make an end
to the acceptable service which thou hast rendered. My
duty is heavy upon my heart, for I have much affection
for thee. I will not farther persuade thee to forego thine
earnest convictions, for I can but honor thy consistency
and unselfishness. To thee, duty demands sacrifice, and
thou dost cheerfully render it. Behold, thy friendship
hath suffered no loss.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou dost honor me too much, O venerable Rabban!
but I thank thee that, even though I lay down my service
in the Assembly of the Wise, I have thy warm favor and
esteem.</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus again moved to take his departure, but the
Rabban seemed unwilling to let him go.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold the hour is at hand for the evening repast!
Stay thou and break bread with us.</q>
</p>

<p>
Gamaliel led the way to the apartment where the simple
evening meal was served; and Serenus was greeted
by Amabel and her mother, with whom he was on friendly
and familiar terms. Mutual esteem and previous visits
had inspired such confidence as might have been bestowed
upon one of the family. Serenus and Amabel
were warm friends, but up to the present time no word
beyond the boundary of simple friendship had ever
passed between them.
</p>

<p>
After the meal was ended, Gamaliel withdrew briefly,
<pb n="123"/><anchor id="Pg123"/>being called to the library by a scribe. As the evening
was sultry, the others repaired to the house-top, where
the Rabban would erelong rejoin them. But soon the
mother was also summoned away; and kind, or unkind,
fate, through fortuitous combination, left Serenus and
Amabel by themselves. An easy seat, sheltered by a
light canopy, which was close by the parapet on the side
overlooking the city, invited their occupancy.
</p>

<p>
The sun long before had hid himself behind the Mount
Ephraim Range in the west; and darkness crept up from
the valleys, and was fast blotting out the tinting and
burnishing that had softly rested upon battlements and
towers, and the neighboring slopes of Olivet. One by
one the city lamps, like fire-flies, twinkled in the growing
gloom, and the starry heaven above solemnly marshalled
its host, while the cheeks of the young pair were fanned
by the balmy evening breeze.
</p>

<p>
Amabel had great respect for the courage and sincerity
of Serenus; but far more than that, his image was deeply
engraven upon her heart. But still, after this long time,
she felt unready to make the confession, even to herself.
As for Serenus, he long had lived among visions, and
alternated between hopes and fears. There had steadily
gleamed in his soul love for Amabel, and at times
ecstasy beyond limit. Of her warm friendship he had
no doubt, but of more he was not sure. Who shall interpret
human hearts to each other?
</p>

<p>
But Serenus had long indulged the delightful dream
which was constantly before him. The beauty and
purity of Amabel made her seem almost like a divinity,
worthy of any sacrifice and devotion, if not actual
hom<pb n="124"/><anchor id="Pg124"/>age. But now, knowing her devoted loyalty to her
church and race, what hope could remain for him? Deprived
of his position by his own irrevocable choice, and
soon to be misunderstood and counted as disloyal to
the interests of the Chosen People, he had virtually
dashed the cup of bliss from his own lips. Was he not
mad in his devotion to a principle, which would not only
cost place and reputation, but also wreck his long-nourished
hopes regarding Amabel? Such were a few
of the thoughts that rushed in a quick procession through
his mind, as he was thrown for a brief period into the
charmed presence. On her part there was an unwonted
reserve. She seemed to feel the approach of a crisis in
her life. The deepening shadows veiled her beautiful
features, but the large lustrous eyes almost shone through
the blackness in soulful radiation.
</p>

<p>
<q>The darkness which from without falls upon us is a
fitting symbol of that which steals about my heart,</q> said
Serenus.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why art thou so cast down, O Serenus?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I would fain answer thy question and open my soul
to thee, fair one; but a great trial is laid upon me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Peradventure I might help thee to bear it.</q>
</p>

<p>
The gloom hid the expression of intense interest which
played upon her face as she had spoken. Serenus was
also like a bow bent to the breaking-point.
</p>

<p>
<q>Sweet Amabel! long have I loved thee! From the
time when at the Lyceum thy speaking eyes thrilled me,
thy charming soul hath been most dear. Thou art the
purest and fairest blossom of Israel in all the Holy
City!</q>
</p>

<pb n="125"/><anchor id="Pg125"/>

<p>
Again the friendly shades of evening veiled the rich
flush which mantled the cheeks of the Jewish maiden.
She was stirred to the depths of her being, but waited to
hear more. Serenus continued,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou wouldst inquire concerning the trial? Can
anything pertaining to love be a trial? I silence my
beating heart to tell thee! Dear Amabel, do not think
me mad! <hi rend="italic">I accept as true the message of the prophet of
Nazareth, whom our own Chosen People counted as a blasphemer,
and have crucified!</hi> He was innocent, just, and
holy! His life was pure, and his love went out to all—even
his persecutors. He lived the full divine pattern
for both Jew and Gentile. His kingdom is an unseen
kingdom, and cometh not with observation. He came
not as an earthly conqueror, to throw off the Roman yoke
by force, but to show men how to unloose the heavier
yoke of spiritual bondage, carnality, and dead works.
There is a light which is in every man, but only the
Man <hi rend="italic">Jesus</hi> hath perfected it in seen demonstration and
expression. Through the power of the Father, to which
he opened himself, he healed the sick, cleansed the
leper, raised the fallen, and saved the sinful, and proclaimed
that all these works are possible to all who are
filled with the same spirit. He hath departed bodily;
but the fulness of life which he showed forth is ever in
the world, waiting for manifestation. The outer tumult
of our lives may be so hushed that we can hear the voice
of Truth in the stillness within. True religion is comprehended
in oneness with the Father, and not in ceremonies
and ordinances.</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus poured out these thoughts as though they had
<pb n="126"/><anchor id="Pg126"/>been burning within him for utterance. After a moment’s
pause he continued,—
</p>

<p>
<q>This is a new faith, howbeit it hath long had some
growth within me. Yea, before the advent of the Nazarene
I felt somewhat of its spirit moving in my heart. I
have made all these things known to thy worthy father.
My reputation and honor among our people is gone, and
my work in the Assembly of the Wise ended! When
these things that I have spoken unto thee reach the ears
of the scribes and elders, I shall be a reproach; yea, persecution
may be meted out to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
The soul of Amabel was wrung with agony as he
continued,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold my trial! O fair daughter of Gamaliel, I
am persuaded of thy loving and pure loyalty to thy
father, thy religion, and thy people! I know my burden,
and must bear it, even though it crush me! I go
out from thy father’s house, and will see thee no
more.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O Serenus, I know well thy noble spirit! Must
these things be?</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus sat with bowed head, and made no answer.
</p>

<p>
Amabel was a loving and dutiful daughter of a tender
father. But with all his kindness, she well knew his
firmness, and had no thought of putting it to the test,
or raising any question. Her whole training and life
had been devoted and consecrated to the religion of
her people. While not bigoted or exclusive, she was
thoroughly sincere in every service. She also fully
divined both the firmness and sincerity of Serenus.
She knew that his impassioned utterances about the
<pb n="127"/><anchor id="Pg127"/>new religion welled up from the depths of his soul, and
saw how dearly they cost him. A great rock had
suddenly been rolled across her pathway, and there
was no way around it. Silently holding herself, and
shrouded by the prevailing obscurity, the great hot tears
fell thick and fast.
</p>

<lg>
<l>Fate’s shuttle weaves the web of life with pain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But in the struggle, see that thou art brave:</l>
<l>When finished, loss may e’en be turned to gain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And love, perchance, enriched with all it gave.</l>
</lg>

<p>
The moments flew swiftly by. Amabel must be loyal,
and she would be brave. She must hide her love, even
because of it. If Serenus knew of it, would it not
double the bitterness of his own cup? Can love suppress
itself in behalf of its own object? Yea, it will
suffer all things.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Serenus! think no more of me! Thou art a noble
spirit, but pray let thy dreams of our future come to
an end. There is a great gulf between us, which love,
even if it possessed me, could not span. It will be for
thy peace if our paths come no more together.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was another silence of several moments, during
which the heart-throbs of each were almost audible, but
no other word could be added. The very palace beneath
them was no more immovable than the fate which destiny
decreed, both by and for them.
</p>

<p>
Serenus found the great question echoing through the
recesses of his heart, as to the real feeling of Amabel
toward him; but there was no solution, and he even
recognized that it were better so. What mattered it, so
<pb n="128"/><anchor id="Pg128"/>long as the gulf that yawned between them was impassable!
</p>

<p>
The silence was soon broken by the return of the
Rabban, who resumed the conversation that had been
interrupted. But he little dreamed what a tension was
upon the two young souls.
</p>

<p>
Serenus soon took his leave, passed out of the palace,
and started down the northerly descent of Mount Zion in
the direction of his quiet home, which was some distance
to the north-west, beyond Hezekiah’s Pool. But
before he had come to the end of the sloping palace
gardens, he saw some deserted seats among the scattered
shrubbery upon one of the terraces, and attracted by the
balminess of the evening, sat down. The opportunity
for silent meditation and composure after the trying
ordeal through which he had passed was very welcome.
He would take his bearings anew, and sound the subtle
recesses of his sorrows and experiences, and confirm
and re-interpret his hopes and aspirations. At length
he looked up into the starry canopy above, and entered
into communion with the Universal, and his fevered
pulse grew calm. He relaxed the soul-tension which
had been upon him, and consciously opened his being
to the eternal and all-prevailing Love and Goodness,
and peace, like a river, flowed in. He was conscious of
an universal reconciliation with all things, past, present,
and future. The unbounded benediction which overwhelmed
him submerged all that had been local, temporary,
and disquieting. His soul expanded, and he
was conscious of an at-one-ment with the whole order
of Nature. It was all in, of, and for him. What, after
<pb n="129"/><anchor id="Pg129"/>all, was the sweetness of the purest and most beautiful
personal affection but a rudimentary lesson, a detached
gleam, from the wide radiance of the unbounded sunlight!
His love for Amabel was like a little purling
rill, finding its way to the ocean, not to be destroyed,
but enfolded in an infinitely Greater. It must become
multiplied, until Amabel is in all people, Jew
and Gentile, Greek and barbarian. If her form be no
more beheld, she shall be an universal interpreter. She
is everywhere, even though unseen. Pierce through the
rough outer coverings of all souls, and the divine germ
of Love is there, only waiting for the light and moisture
of consciousness so that it may swell and spring forth.
Amabel is in the whispering of the breeze, the glow of
the sunlight, the shimmer of the wave, the sighing of
the forest, and the patter of the rain-drop. Divine
Love at first can be interpreted only through its personified
sample, which kindles the beginning of a flame
in the human soul.
</p>

<p>
Serenus lingered long enough to make the world over
for himself through the choice of an ideal standpoint.
He had learned the secret of spiritual alchemy, so that
the Universal was mirrored within him. His spirit enlarged
to make room for a mighty influx of love, peace,
and power which were borne in upon him. With soul
calmed and filled with spiritual might he arose, and with
light heart and elastic step started toward his destination.
Passing through a long, narrow street just to the
north of the tall cenotaph of Mariamne, and leaving the
square of the Sheepmarket a little to the east, he continued
towards home. It was midnight, and the streets and
<pb n="130"/><anchor id="Pg130"/>lanes were lonely and nearly deserted. But as he came
near a small secluded open court by the side of a wine-shop,
he heard a confusion of voices. He hurried his
pace, and coming nearer discerned a prostrate form
surrounded by four or five turbulent fellows, who were
searching the garments of their victim for valuables.
He sprang into their midst; and the onslaught was so
sudden that the men, thinking that one of the Roman
guard was at hand, scattered and ran in different directions.
They already had secured all the booty they
could find, and had no disposition to return.
</p>

<p>
Serenus gently moved the body to a more secure spot
not far away, and removing his own tunic, folded it, and
placed it under the head of the wounded man. Espying
a legionary guard in the distance, who carried a torch,
he called to him, and reported the robbery. They carefully
examined the man, but found no wound. He was a
Jew of small stature, delicate and deathly pale, and, except
a hurried gasping for breath, entirely motionless.
Everything indicated that he had fainted in the street,
and that the young barbarians, finding him in that helpless
condition, had taken occasion to rob him. His eyes
were closed, but soon there was a little more evidence of
animation. At length he began to mutter incoherently,
as if dreaming. Serenus loosened his neck-cloth, chafed
his limbs, and stroked back his dishevelled locks, and
behold, the face had a familiar look. The muttering
continued, and became more audible.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Cassia! <hi rend="italic">Cassia!</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">O Cassia!</hi> Oh! Oh!</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus knew nothing of <q>Cassia;</q> but a quick vision
of the past flashed before him, and he beheld a face
<pb n="131"/><anchor id="Pg131"/>to which the colorless features bore a striking resemblance.
</p>

<p>
<q>Saulus! Yea, it is Saulus! My old comrade of the
Assembly and the Lyceum!</q>
</p>

<p>
It was known to Serenus that Saulus had lodged
aforetime at the inn of the Sheepmarket; and as it was
not far away, he and the legionary tenderly bore him
thither. They knocked at the outer portal; but as it
was far into the night, all were sleeping. But continuing,
Almon at length made his appearance, and after
explanation admitted them. Saulus had become more
quiet, but was still unconscious. When he had been
carefully placed upon a soft couch, the Roman departed.
</p>

<p>
<q>O my dear friend Saulus!</q> said Almon sorrowfully;
<q>thou hast nearly perished! O Saulus! Saulus!</q>
</p>

<p>
He started to arouse his wife and Cassia; but Serenus
advised that they be not disturbed, but that he himself
be permitted to minister to the unconscious Saulus for a
little time before taking his departure.
</p>

<p>
There was something so reassuring and commanding
in the mien of Serenus that the innkeeper consented
without a question.
</p>

<p>
<q>With the rising of the sun, behold thou shalt see him
entirely whole!</q> exclaimed Serenus.
</p>

<p>
Almon was then beckoned to stillness; and he seated
himself at a little distance, and looked on with astonishment.
Serenus gently took the hands of Saulus in his
own, and seating himself, rested his calm gaze upon the
pale face before him.
</p>

<p>
The room was filled with a mysterious stillness, and
there was a feeling as of a <hi rend="italic">Presence</hi>. To Almon there
<pb n="132"/><anchor id="Pg132"/>seemed to be an added surrounding brightness, and he
was filled with a holy awe which he could not understand.
Then he thought he heard the stranger whisper
a benediction. Soon Saulus wearily opened his eyes
and looked about him, but failed to recognize his surroundings.
There was another profound silence, and
another benediction in soft but now audible tones.
</p>

<p>
Then the sick man gaped twice, turned upon his side,
and sank into a sweet, natural slumber. Soon his deep,
regular breathing indicated sound and refreshing sleep.
Almon marvelled. Serenus arose to take his departure,
only saying,—
</p>

<p>
<q>He is well.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What a wonderful work! Who art thou, kind
stranger?</q>
</p>

<p>
He only replied, <q>A friend of Saulus,</q> and softly
passing through the portal went out into the darkness.

<p>
It was but two days to the great Jewish festival of
Pentecost, and Jerusalem was already thronged with pilgrims.
They came pouring in through all the great
thoroughfares,—from Damascus to the northward, which
entered near Golgotha; from the seaports to the west
and northwest, through the defiles of the hill-country of
Mount Ephraim, and from the south, approaching through
the valley of Kedron; also along the lesser byways—a
great host. They journeyed in families, parties, and
festal bands, singing songs and praises, and bringing
offerings. The air was stirred with a thrill of national
pride and exaltation. Even the great overshadowing
cloud of the Roman dominion could not dampen the
ardor nor repress the spirit of the harvest festival commonly
known as the Feast of Weeks.
</p>

<p>
The Hebrew had an unbounded faith in the future
and permanent redemption of the Lord’s people, and his
ideal of restoration and final triumph was ever before
him. However galling the shackles, their loosening had
<pb n="134"/><anchor id="Pg134"/>been decreed, and was expected. Even the pilgrims of
the more distant countries of the Dispersion were in no
wise behind in their ardor as they gathered at the sacred
city, <q>whither the tribes go up.</q> Each loyal heart
swelled with pride as the great Temple came into view,
where the God of Israel found his special dwelling-place
in the Holy of Holies, from which he radiated his glory.
</p>

<p>
During the great Hebrew festivals every son of Israel
who lived in the Holy City hospitably opened his house
to the pilgrims; and as the climate was warm during the
month Sivan, thousands slept upon roofs, and also encamped
in and around the city. Many pitched tents
within the limits of a <q>Sabbath day’s journey</q> outside
the walls.
</p>

<p>
Among the great throng was a little party of four from
the distant seaport of Tarsus. The aged priest Abdiel,
with Benoni and his wife and Rebecca, came not only to
attend the festival, but for a longer sojourn. Their arrival
was a few days later than that of Saulus, he having
been charged to make provision for their necessities.
They were to abide at the Sheepmarket.
</p>

<p>
The little Tarsian group approached by the road from
Cæsarea, and coming upon the elevation beyond the
walls to the northwest, beheld the City of David spread
out before them. The roof of the Temple, which crowned
Moriah, overlaid with beaten gold, glittered in the warm
Judean sunshine; and as the eyes of Abdiel rested upon
it, he fell on his knees, and stretched out his hands
toward heaven.
</p>

<p>
<q>The God of Israel be praised! Long aforetime the
eyes of thy servant rested upon thy Holy Hill, and now,
<pb n="135"/><anchor id="Pg135"/>once more, behold the Glory of the Whole Earth is
spread before me.</q>
</p>

<p>
He then arose, and looking up to heaven, repeated
from the Psalms of David,—
</p>

<lg>
<l>“In Salem also is his tabernacle,</l>
<l>And his dwelling-place in Zion.</l>
<l>My covenant will I not break,</l>
<l>Nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</l>
<l>Once have I sworn by my holiness;</l>
<l>I will not lie unto David;</l>
<l>His seed shall endure forever,</l>
<l>And his throne as the sun before me.”</l>
</lg>

<p>
He ceased, and again fastened his gaze upon the Holy
Hill. But anon a tremor shook his frame, his eyes became
fixed, and he was as one in a deep trance. His
countenance changed, his lips seemed moved by some
mysterious power, and a message which was like a prophecy
came out of his mouth. Even the voice was not that
of Abdiel.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold, little ones are born already whose eyes shall
see Jerusalem as a heap of ruins. Sons of Israel will
arise against each other, and strife and famine among
thy people ravage thee within, while Roman cohorts invest
thee from without. Battering rams will cause thy
bulwarks to crumble; thy palaces shall be sacked, thy
towers crushed, and thy Temple destroyed by fire. Pestilence,
famine, and war shall bring thee to utter desolation,
until thou lie in heaps. Thy glory shall vanish,
thy name become a reproach and a hissing, and the Gentiles
shall level thy ruins and dwell upon them.</q>
</p>

<p>
Again the frame of Abdiel was shaken, and he came
to himself.
</p>

<pb n="136"/><anchor id="Pg136"/>

<p>
<q>Behold, O Benoni, I have seen an exceeding calamitous
vision!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O Rabbi Abdiel! we have heard thee prophesy evil
concerning the Holy City!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wot not that I had spoken; but oh, the vision!
Here where Jerusalem lieth stretched out before me, lo!
I beheld a mighty battle. Famine, sword, and fire prevailed,
and then anon I saw but an ash-heap!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold, O Rabbi Abdiel, peradventure a lying spirit
hath possessed thee, and used thy lips!</q>
</p>

<p>
The venerable priest marvelled.

<p>
The day of the great and most joyous of the Jewish
festivals opened bright but sultry. The early morning
sun was pouring his warm beams over Mount Olivet,
and gilding tower and roof, as Serenus wended his way
toward a large upper chamber which was just below the
westerly slope of the Holy Hill. This was where the
disciples of the prophet of Nazareth were wont to gather,
day by day, before the third hour. It was his first visit,
and he was unknown to the followers of the Nazarene.
From his youth in Alexandria, where he had been instructed
by the great teacher Philo, he had been free in
spirit from the traditions of the elders. He had learned
somewhat of the Greek philosophy, and also dwelt for
a season among the devoted Jewish sects of the Essenes
and Therapeutæ. Being of a singularly pure and religious
nature, he found the best in each, and attained to
much wisdom and discernment, even before he came to
Jerusalem. While a Jew by birth, and yet an observer
of the more simple forms of the Hebrew worship, he had
<pb n="137"/><anchor id="Pg137"/>gradually found them burdensome, until his free declarations
concerning the Spirit of Truth made it expedient
even for the tolerant Gamaliel to part with him. He
had long accounted the kingdom of God as a spiritual
kingdom, having no connection with the government of
the Jewish nation. He felt that its seat was within, and
that its coming would be without observation.
</p>

<p>
Serenus had lived the Sermon on the Mount before
its audible delivery. During the public life and ministry
of Jesus of Nazareth, he had continued with Gamaliel,
but had watched intently the spirit and teaching of the
newly arisen prophet. While not aforetime casting in
his lot with his immediate followers, he was in perfect
accord with his work and mission. Day by day he had
lived in the hope that the sonship which had expression
in the great prophet might find knowledge and favor of
the Rabbis and all the people. His own life and teaching
with Gamaliel were to the end of the hastening of
peace and righteousness, and the reign on earth of love
and good will. Before the Nazarene had appeared, he
felt within himself the eternal Christly spirit, or that
divine mind and will which was so soon to have new
and perfected incarnation. But when the scribes and
elders persecuted and slew the Man in whom the Word
was articulated, he must needs forego all conformity to
them, avow the Truth, and peradventure suffer persecution
himself.
</p>

<p>
Serenus found the large upper chamber well filled, and
those who had gathered were speaking words of gladness
and praise. Their faces shone with the spirit of
love, and there was perfect accord and unity. Men and
<pb n="138"/><anchor id="Pg138"/>women prophesied, each one as moved by inspiration;
and there were also times of silence, when all were possessed
with a spiritual ecstasy which no tongue could
interpret. All were stirred to open themselves to the
Holy Spirit, and it filled and overflowed them. Love
was so eloquent in every countenance that all, whatever
their native language, heard and understood its voice in
their own souls. Each one praised and magnified God
for his heavenly vision, and all felt that these were the
first fruits of a new spiritual dominion. Every one offered
his unbounded service to his neighbor, and mighty works
of ministry and healing attested the power of the spirit
which was in them. Their joy knew no measure. Those
who had been slow of speech waxed eloquent, the weak
grew strong, the fearful became bold, and the unlearned
spoke words of wisdom. Serenus marvelled and rejoiced
as he heard their utterances.
</p>

<p>
<q>Glory to God for he is our strength!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Peace and good will to all on earth!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We give free course to the same spirit which filled
Jesus of Nazareth!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The goodness of the Lord enlargeth our heart!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The chains of captives fall off and they go free!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Our eyes behold thy salvation!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The way of life is made plain before us!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Our countenances shine with the glory of thy presence!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The day of the Lord hath dawned!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Signs and wonders are multiplied!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold our sons and daughters shall prophesy!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A great light hath been kindled in our souls!</q>
</p>

<pb n="139"/><anchor id="Pg139"/>

<p>
<q>The Spirit of Truth is in our midst!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Our love aboundeth toward all men!</q>
</p>

<p>
Such were a few of the manifold testimonies.
</p>

<p>
The soul of Serenus was aflame with praise and gladness.
Looking about him, he perceived that nearly all
who had gathered were unlearned, and of no reputation;
such as had contempt of the Pharisees and doctors of
the Law. Whence this wonderful wisdom! Oh, joyful
demonstration! Behold the tabernacle of God is now
within the hearts of men!
</p>

<lg>
<l>O breath of God! breathed by his children now,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Free course his spirit hath; their souls aspire.</l>
<l>With life and love their hearts thou dost endow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Baptized e’en now with warmth of heavenly fire.</l>
</lg>

<p>
Serenus was inspired to mingle his wisdom with that
of this spiritual love-feast, and he addressed the assembly:—
</p>

<p>
<q>Brethren, it is good to be here; for lo, the power of
God filleth this place. But peradventure ye persuade
yourselves that God hath become more willing than he
was wont, and therefore hath repented him of the past,
and now poureth out his Spirit more abundantly. Nay!
His Spirit hath always been poured out, for it filleth all
things; but now, with one accord, ye have opened yourselves
to it. Behold God hath not changed, for he hath
everlasting perfection, and abideth everywhere. He is
not like unto men, giving or withholding his favor by
times and seasons, but is everlasting fulness, now and
through all time, to all who discover him and find his
kingdom within. Behold the same mind which filled the
<pb n="140"/><anchor id="Pg140"/>Nazarene to the uttermost dwelleth unmanifested in all;
but they wot not of its presence, for they look without,
expecting it to come with observation. While Jesus was
with you after the flesh, behold your eyes were holden
by his bodily presence, but now ye see how the Spirit
of the Messiah aboundeth unto all. God dwelleth not
in oblations and circumcisions and ordinances, nay, even
not in yonder Temple more than in all the earth, for his
presence is everywhere. Behold, whether Jew or Gentile,
Parthian, Mede, or Elamite, be ye renewed in the
inner man, for there is where God speaketh. As ye put
on the Christly mind, which was incarnated in Jesus, ye
have salvation within you. His blood, being interpreted,
betokens his inmost eternal quality; and this is Spirit,
and this is life. Till now ye knew not that ye had
Christ in you, waiting for your outworking. But now ye
have opened your vision, and therefore abound in faith,
and show forth God’s power as it becometh his children.
I salute every one of you in love.</q>
</p>

<p>
As Serenus concluded, many gathered about him, and
grasped him by the hand, and blessed and saluted him.
</p>

<p>
The news of the unwonted fervor of the assembly soon
became noised abroad; and many who were curious hastily
gathered, and marvelled at what they saw. Many false
reports went out concerning it, until one Peter, a disciple,
formerly weak, but now of great boldness, lifted up
his voice and made explanation, showing that according
to prophecy all these things should come to pass.
</p>

<p>
After Serenus went out, he joined the great throng,
and went up to the Jewish Pentecost at the Temple.
He desired once more to behold the great national
fes<pb n="141"/><anchor id="Pg141"/>tival of his own people, to which the pilgrims from all
the scattered tribes had come up.
</p>

<p>
The tramp of a multitude of feet resounded through
the outer courts. The strange costumes of Jews and
proselytes from Mesopotamia and Cappadocia, from Pontus,
Egypt, and Arabia, mingled in picturesque color and
design with the less conspicuous habiliments of the denizens
of the Holy City. There was a great confusion
of tongues and dialects, and the tables of the money-changers
were loaded with piles of strange coins from
many countries. The dues of the Temple, and the price
of lambs, goats, and bullocks, must needs be paid for in
the sacred money of Judea. There were great pens containing
lambs of the first year, selected by the priests as
being without blemish, and rams and he-goats, approved
as sound, to be sold for sacrifices, the large profit going
to the priests, as pertaining to their office. The bleating
and lowing of the herds that were crowded into the
great Temple market—soon to suffer religious martyrdom—was
mingled with the vast babel of other sounds
and voices. The marble pavement was littered with
refuse, and would soon be stained with blood, poured
out by the priests in conformity to the ceremonial law.
The blare of silver trumpets, and the reverberation of
patriotic and religious anthems, which were sung as ordained
by the Levites, also formed a part of the great
chorus. All the broad spaces on Mount Moriah swarmed
with humanity, and the sweltering, brassy air vibrated
with clamor and motion. The Gate Beautiful, which led
from the court of the Gentiles to that of the Women, was
flung wide open, and its fair proportions awakened the
<pb n="142"/><anchor id="Pg142"/>pride of every Hebrew. Farther on, and leading into
the court of Israel, was the still more celebrated Gate
of Nicanor, made of polished Corinthian brass, which
was so brilliant in the bright sunshine as to dazzle
every beholder.
</p>

<p>
At length the ceremonies began. The priests, dressed
in long white robes, moved with unsandalled feet to and
fro in long processions with military precision, and finally
ranged themselves in a great semicircle, each with
two leavened loaves and a peace offering, and waved
them before the Lord. The animals were slain in great
numbers, and placed upon the altars for the appointed
sacrifices, the fires were lighted, and the smoke of incense
ascended toward heaven, until the fierce rays of
the sun were almost shut out by the great cloud that
hung over the Holy Hill. At length the silver trumpets
blew a great blast as a signal for silence. The High
Priest, flanked by his subordinates, advanced upon an
elevated gallery in the sight of the vast multitude,
stretched forth his hands toward heaven with fingers mystically
dispread, and blessed the people in the name of
the God of Israel. The heart of every Hebrew swelled
with pride as the great festal service was celebrated, and
even Roman centurions looked on with interest.
</p>

<p>
Serenus was deeply moved as he silently viewed the
mighty concourse, and witnessed the elaborate ritual
which in the past concerned him, and had been wrapped
about his whole life. He then thanked God that the fetters
which had held him even lightly were now broken,
and that the light of truth had shone into his soul, and
destroyed a yoke of bondage which long had been galling.
</p>

<pb n="143"/><anchor id="Pg143"/>

<p>
Serenus secured a position somewhat elevated above
the heads of the people, just inside of the Beautiful
Gate; and from it he made a wide survey of the imposing
ceremonies of the Feast of Weeks. He marvelled
how this favored people, the descendants of Abraham
and possessors of a rich spiritual heritage, had disregarded
the warnings of old, and permitted their worship
to degenerate into outward legality and form. The
simple ordinances, which once were only the tokens of a
pure inner faith, had become an unceasing round of cumbersome
and dead observances. The life of the Jewish
system had withered, and the cup of bitterness of the
Chosen People was fast filling up. But what could he
or the little band of the upper chamber do, to clothe
with flesh and life the dry bones of the dead religious
faith of a dispersed race? Such were a few of his musings
when he beheld the great throng, as they surged in
and out before him.
</p>

<p>
But suddenly the air grew thick, and a heavier cloud
than that of the sacrificial smoke overshadowed the
temple courts. It was growing late in the afternoon,
and a sudden tempest was at hand, following the great
heat. Anon a blinding flash of lightning and peal of
thunder that shook the very foundations of the Temple.
A darkness fell like that of night, which was made
thicker by contrast with the flashes which now seemed
like fiery serpents, shooting through and around the
Temple, and leaping athwart the heavens. A panic
seized the great throng, and there was a mad rush to
escape. Cries of anguish rent the air, as many were
trampled down by the affrighted mass. Many were
<pb n="144"/><anchor id="Pg144"/>crushed by the pressure of the crowd behind, and all
semblance of order was lost in the great struggle for life.
Men, women, and children were pressed against the
platform upon which Serenus was seated, and even those
who were able to keep upright were borne helplessly
along. There was a chorus of groans almost below his
feet. He fell upon his breast, and found that by
reaching down to the utmost, he was able to grasp the
hands of some who were borne upon the shoulders of
others. In this way he was able to rescue not a few,
by lifting them to the level of the platform where he
was. By the light of a vivid flash, he saw in the drifting
current an elderly man, upon whose shoulders there
was a young woman, whose drooping form and pale face
showed that she had swooned. The man who carried
her aloft had a glimpse of Serenus above him, and cried
out as he was swept along,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Take her! Oh, save her! save her!</q>
</p>

<p>
By a supreme effort, Serenus was able to grasp her
arm, and lift her to his own level, while he who had
made the entreaty was quickly lost to sight in the irresistible
moving tide and thick darkness. Serenus laid her
tenderly down; and another woman, whom he before had
lifted by his strong grasp, assisted in ministration. The
face of the prostrate form was of the Jewish type, but
her features were regular and beautiful. Her long black
hair hung in wild confusion, as if to symbolize the disorderly
scene through which she had passed. Her costume
betokened refinement and social standing. Around
her white neck there was a network of delicate gold
chains interspersed with small precious stones. The
<pb n="145"/><anchor id="Pg145"/>folds of her white loose-fitting robe, of soft texture, were
gathered by a girdle woven of golden threads, from
which hung pendants of small pearls.
</p>

<p>
After a vigorous fanning and a little interval of rest,
she gasped, opened her eyes, and slowly came to herself.
</p>

<p>
<q>O my father! where art thou? O Saulus!</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus marvelled.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is Saulus thy friend? Pray, who art thou?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am Rebecca, the daughter of Benoni of Tarsus.</q>
</p>

</div><div type="chapter" n="16" rend="page-break-before: always">

<head>CHAPTER XVI<lb/>AFTER THE STORM</head>

<p>
The fury of the storm rapidly diminished. The great
rushing tide of men, women, and children soon thinned
out and grew sluggish. The darkness lifted, and the
lightning-flashes and peals of thunder died away, but
the great worshipful throng was demoralized and scattered.
</p>

<p>
The panic began when some marble columns in the
tier beyond the court of Israel had been struck by lightning,
and shattered and thrown down, wounding several
priests, who were washing their hands in the great
brazen Laver. Such was the starting-point of the stampede
which had been so disastrous and widespread.
</p>

<p>
Rebecca was uninjured, and rapidly recovered from
the prevailing fright and excitement. Except for the
anxiety regarding the fate of her father, she was soon
quite herself. She turned to her unknown deliverer to
render him thanks.
</p>

<p>
<q>The God of Israel reward thee, O son of Judah!
Thy gracious ministry was my salvation. Receive the
thanks of the daughter of Benoni. My father will joyfully
bless thee, and also reward thy goodness if thou
wilt accept some favor.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Fair maid of the house of Benoni! the Lord hath
<pb n="147"/><anchor id="Pg147"/>already rewarded me abundantly, for I have much joy in
thy deliverance.</q>
</p>

<p>
The pallor and weakness which marked her face gradually
passed away, and gave place to a look of interest
and curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<q>It all seems like a confused dream. I remember
that my father lifted me to his shoulders to bear me out
of the mad throng, and I knew nothing further until I
found myself here.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He delivered thee into my hands, by his own words,
and now, behold we will seek him.</q>
</p>

<p>
Rebecca was now able to walk, and they passed out
through the Beautiful Gate in quest of Benoni. There
were groups of people everywhere; many drenched by
the great storm, some faint or wounded, and a few of
the more helpless were being borne away by friends,
or keepers of the Temple courts. But the father of
Rebecca was nowhere to be found.
</p>

<p>
<q>Peradventure he hath been bruised or faint, and taken
to the inn of Almon where we abide. I will return
thither. But I am a stranger in the Holy City. May I
still presume upon thy favor in that thou wouldst show
me the way?</q>
</p>

<p>
The sky had already cleared, the air was sweet and
fresh, and the sun dispensing his parting beams before
sinking below the western horizon.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold what a great calm follows the tempest,</q> said
Rebecca. <q>The Holy City seems purified.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A fitting symbol of the storms and waves that rage in
the soul of man,</q> said Serenus. <q>They chasten, and then
in due time bring forth a harvest of peace.</q>
</p>

<pb n="148"/><anchor id="Pg148"/>

<p>
<q>Must peace of soul come only as the result of
tempest?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I say not that; but yet life is like the ebb and flow
of the tides. If stillness were never broken up, peradventure
there would be stagnation. It is the fury of the
storm that gives tranquillity its charm.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Should we, then, seek for waves to buffet us?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay; but when they come unsought, we should be
lifted by them rather than submerged.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Peradventure one be not able?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That must not be conceded even to ourselves.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is the secret of overcoming?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Keep a well-ordered mind, for our life is what our
thoughts make it. Look beneath the surface of things.
When the billows of the sea are angry, and foam and
dash themselves, there is serenity in their unseen deeps.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou must account thyself a philosopher as well as
a son of Israel.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Daughter of Benoni! I am a Jew; but the Chosen
People are not the sole possessors of wisdom. It
aboundeth through all the earth, but only they who
seek it for its own sake taste of its fulness.</q>
</p>

<p>
They passed out through the west Temple gate of the
outer court, and down the long flight of steps along the
slope of Mount Moriah. The steep descent caused
Rebecca again to grow dizzy from faintness, and she
leaned upon Serenus for support. He put his arm about
her to save her from falling, and thus they made their
way as rapidly as possible toward the Sheepmarket. As
they entered a narrow street, they met, face to face, a
young woman moving with a rapid step in the opposite
<pb n="149"/><anchor id="Pg149"/>direction. She gave Serenus a slight salutation, and
quickly passed by. He was still supporting Rebecca,
and was startled at the recognition. It was Amabel.
</p>

<p>
Arriving at the inn, Rebecca invited Serenus to enter,
and receive the thanks of her friends. But he made
some plea of haste, and turned to depart, only saying,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Peace abide with thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
She returned the salutation, and then, remembering
that he had not made himself known, except as a son of
Israel, inquired,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Who art thou, that we may send thee greeting for
thy great favor?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am a friend of Saulus;</q> and before her knock was
answered, he was out of sight.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p>
A few days after, late in the afternoon, a little group
were holding earnest converse in the court of the Sheepmarket
inn. Abdiel, the venerable Rabbi of Tarsus,
bewailed the changes which had come to pass in the
Holy City since his long sojourn there many years
before.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold,</q> he exclaimed bitterly, <q>false prophets and
teachers have arisen, and boldly proclaim their blasphemous
doctrines in the synagogues, yea, in the very courts
of the Temple on the Holy Hill. The streams which
should flow out in pure volume to refresh and confirm
the children of the Dispersion are becoming poisoned
at the fountain-head.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is even as thou sayest, O venerable Abdiel!</q> replied
Almon. <q>We may almost perceive heresy and false
doctrine in the very air about us! It cometh mainly from
<pb n="150"/><anchor id="Pg150"/>the followers of an impostor named Jesus of Nazareth,
who was crucified not long ago between two thieves.
His disciples have waxed yet more bold in their teachings;
and some of them set at naught the Holy Place
itself, while others continue in the ordinances of the
Chosen People, but lightly esteem them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What manner of people are they? and what is their
doctrine?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Saulus is more learned in these matters, and can
more perfectly inform thee.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have heard from common report, since coming
from Tarsus, somewhat of the Galilean and his doings.
He was without reputation or learning, but by certain
charms and magical works and healings was able to
deceive many. He even made pretence to the Messiahship,
boasted that he could destroy the Temple in three
days, and called himself the King of the Jews.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As he was no king, and did nothing to restore the
kingdom and drive out the Roman, peradventure he was
mad, or possessed of an evil spirit,</q> said Abdiel.
</p>

<p>
<q>That matters not, O venerable Rabbi! so long as his
followers are multiplied and have waxed bold. They
must be driven out or destroyed, otherwise great harm
will befall the church of our fathers. It hath come to
my ears, O Almon! that my former enemy, the false
teacher Serenus, hath joined himself to these blasphemers,
and that the Rabban hath put him away from the Assembly.
It behooveth us to be vigilant, else this heresy
may spread even to the overthrow of our nation and
people. I shall counsel with the High Priest on the
morrow, and take measures to rid the Holy City of these
<pb n="151"/><anchor id="Pg151"/>deceivers who are persuading the common people with
their vain pretensions.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou speakest with wisdom and boldness,</q> said
Almon; <q>yet it behooveth thee to proceed with caution
and secrecy, for this new doctrine hath taken a strong
hold upon the ignorant and unlearned. I have heard
of one Stephanos, who is vehement for the strange heresy.
He is young and learned, and speaketh both in the
Hebrew and Greek tongues.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It hath been told me, O Almon! how he stirreth up
the people by his eloquence, and of his disputations,
whereby he may gain a great following. Peradventure
on the morrow he may be at the synagogue of the Cyrenians,
as hath been wont. I will go and confront this
calumniator of our Holy Law.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The God of Israel be with thee!</q> said Abdiel.
<q>Thou art strong and courageous in the defence of our
doctrine.</q>
</p>

<p>
Since the return of Saulus he had been earnestly occupied
in the formation of plans for the uprooting of false
doctrine, and the punishment of the violators of the
ceremonial law. His zeal in this cause was only alternated
and tempered by his periods of depression and
uncertainty as to the affection of Cassia. His strength
as a champion of the traditions of the elders was only
equalled by the power of his love for her, but the former
inspired strength and the latter weakness. He could
face unnumbered heretics without a fear, but was vanquished
by the sight of the innkeeper’s daughter. Day
after day had swiftly passed since his return from Tarsus,
but still he was utterly in the dark as to her real feelings.
<pb n="152"/><anchor id="Pg152"/>She was friendly, and took a deep interest in all his
plans for crushing the traitors in the camp of Israel, but
more he could not clearly divine. He was holden from
making any allusion to the involuntary eavesdropping
upon the occasion of his arrival; and what he had heard
on the part of little Cassia had been so indefinite that
he lived in a condition of mingled hope, fear, and uncertainty.
Barnabas was still at the Sheepmarket, but
there was nothing in his actions to aid in the solution
of the riddle. Saulus loved with all the intensity of
his fiery nature; and he even persuaded himself that if
Cassia loved Barnabas, he could do nothing but flee the
Holy City, and so drifted along, not daring to find out
the truth. The suspense could not much longer be
borne.
</p>

<p>
As he retired to his chamber after the conversation, he
sat down to commune with himself, and decide upon
some course of action. His was no ordinary affection.
The world without little Cassia would be a desert.

The synagogue of the Cyrenians was in the valley of
the Cheesemongers, a little to the northeast of the Pool
of Siloam. It was a simple, square building, severely
plain in the interior, with Scripture-texts printed on the
whitewashed walls. The platform was enclosed by a
rail, and occupied at times by any male member of the
synagogue who could read and expound the Law. The
seats were divided into two sections by a lattice-work
partition, the men <anchor id="corr153"/><corr sic="occuping">occupying</corr> one side, and the women the
other. The services were not confined to the Sabbath,
but often held on other days of the week, and sometimes
in the evening.
</p>

<p>
It was a bright morning, and the synagogue was
thronged with worshippers, part being Sadducees; and
there were also many Jews who were pilgrims from the
countries beyond Judea, having remained after the Feast
of Pentecost. It had been noised abroad that Stephanos,
the eloquent young apostle of the New Faith, would
speak touching the interpretation of the Law and prophets.
Many knew of him; for he had healed some sick
folk, and done signs and wonders among the common
<pb n="154"/><anchor id="Pg154"/>people. Abdiel, Benoni, Saulus, and Cassia convened
with the congregation. The rulers of the synagogue
had consented that Stephanos should lead in the exposition
of Scripture for that day. Comely and youthful in
appearance, he stepped upon the platform, and searching
among the rolls of the Law, brought out many passages,
which he read and briefly expounded as he passed along.
He then re-rolled them carefully, and putting them away,
addressed the assembly.
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Ye men of Israel! I count myself happy to proclaim
to you the Dispensation now beginning, which betokens
the fulfilment of great promises, not to the Jews only,
but to all the nations of the earth. Ye are the inheritors
of the promise made to Abraham: <q>And in thy seed
shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</q> And
again, Moses indeed saith, <q>A prophet shall the Lord
God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like
unto me; to him shall ye hearken in all things, whatsoever
he shall speak unto you.</q> Daniel prophesieth of
the setting up of <q>an everlasting kingdom,</q> and this kingdom
is at hand. David asked to <q>find a habitation for
the God of Jacob.</q> <q>But the Most High dwelleth not in
houses made with hands;</q> as saith the prophet,—</q>
</p>

<lg>
<l>‘The heaven is my throne,</l>
<l>And the earth the footstool of my feet.’</l>
</lg>

<p>
<q>And now, behold Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth, was
he in whom <q>all the families of the earth shall be
blessed.</q> Him have ye slain, and taken his blood upon
you and your children. He was the Son of God; and
his kingdom, being a spiritual kingdom, will know no
<pb n="155"/><anchor id="Pg155"/>end. Ye look for a king who will restore your nation,
but I warn you that no such sign may be given. The
kingdom of God filleth the whole earth. The Holy
Spirit hath been poured out, and dwelleth with all who
seek its guidance. Jesus, after the flesh, we know no
more; but the same spirit that was in him aboundeth
unto all who will receive it. It yieldeth fruits of faith,
hope, love, courage, and patience, and is peaceful, longsuffering,
and kind. It is an awakening of a higher life
and mind in men, be they Jew or Gentile. Behold it
maketh all things new, for its faith is fruitful and multiplieth
all good. God requireth not sacrifices, burnt-offerings,
and ceremonial oblations, but would have a
pure worship. Neither doth circumcision avail anything
except it be of the heart. Ye turn your backs upon the
commandment of God while holding fast to the tradition
of men.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold the reviler of the Chosen People and our holy
Law,</q> cried a voice, interrupting. It was that of Saulus.
<q>Men of Israel! I call ye to witness the blasphemy
which cometh out of his mouth. He hath spoken against
the Temple, and contemned the Holy of Holies which is
the dwelling-place of the God of our fathers. He hath
extolled the impostor, whom our people, with righteous
indignation, crucified in the company of thieves. He
profaneth and setteth at naught the circumcision. He
revileth all the holy ordinances which were commanded
of our fathers, and would turn the Hebrew worship upside
down. I adjure ye, O men of Israel! that ye have
account of his words, and he shall answer before the
Sanhedrin.</q>
</p>

<pb n="156"/><anchor id="Pg156"/>

<p>
There was great confusion in the assembly; and some
were minded to bear Stephanos away by force, and others
that he be permitted to speak. He raised his hand as
a signal for silence, but the uproar continued. Finding
that the tumult could not be quelled, he left the synagogue
under the protection of a few apostles of the New
Faith, declaring that he would speak further of the coming
Dispensation on the morrow.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p>
On the evening of the same day, Saulus received the
hearty greetings of his friends at the Sheepmarket. Besides
the families of Benoni and the innkeeper, many
of the former friends of Saulus, members of the <foreign rend="italic">Urim</foreign>,
came to encourage, and if necessary support, their valiant
leader in the warfare he had in view. There was a secret
gathering of the order the same evening; and it was
finally agreed that all would be at the Cyrenian synagogue
at the next meeting, and that Stephanos should
not be allowed to speak.
</p>

<p>
After parting with his comrades for the night, Saulus
returned to the inn. The evening was sultry; and he
went to the house-top to breathe the fresh air, and cool
the feverish emotions which stirred him. The moon was
full; and the City of David, with the mountains which
encompass it, lay spread out in clear outline and dreamy
repose. Other persons were scattered in different parts
of the commodious resort upon the roof; but as Saulus
was in a troubled mood, he sought a retired corner where
he could be alone. Absorbing as had been the interest
in his people, their religion, and the impending conflict
with Stephanos, his thoughts of these things were
speed<pb n="157"/><anchor id="Pg157"/>ily crowded out by the ever-present image of little Cassia.
She had been enshrined in his thoughts so long that she
had gained a rightful residence, and he could not dismiss
her if he would. She was the unanswered question
that stirred his heart, ever pressing for solution, so that
it kept his soul in a constant agitation. His ruling aspiration,
learning, and leadership in the church of his
fathers, nay, his whole character and life, seemed to be
merged and transformed into a great passionate longing
for the ever-present Ideal which was mirrored in his soul.
It was the charming but uncertain centre about which
everything else revolved.
</p>

<p>
The stillness of the starry heavens rebuked the madness
of his wild passion, and pleaded eloquently for serenity
among the disorderly elements of human attachment;
but the appeal was unheeded. The pinions of his soul
beat and were wounded against the bars of the cage
which hemmed him in. A love so supreme was tyrannical,
so that he almost wished to be freed, and that it
might all vanish from his breast. He felt oppressed,
fevered, and thoroughly enslaved. He leaned forward,
bowed his head, and tightly pressed his throbbing brow.
A misty, strange vision possessed him. Everything he
beheld was being rent in twain. Some Force took hold
of him, and he felt as if his own soul were severed and
divided. At length he saw Cassia borne away through
the air by some implacable Power, but her hands were
stretched out imploringly towards him. He unconsciously
uttered a deep groan, and the intensity of his agony
aroused him. A quick, light step, and some one was at
his side. He lifted his head, and saw Cassia.
</p>

<pb n="158"/><anchor id="Pg158"/>

<p>
<q>Art thou ill, Saulus? Behold, I heard thee speak
loudly as if in anguish, and thou calledst my name.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O Cassia! I had fallen asleep, and dreamed of evil.
Regard it not, I pray thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, Saulus, thou art pale and trembling. I will
bring wine to refresh thee.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay, I want for nothing but peace and rest, and they
can come only of the Future.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I would give thee comfort, Saulus. Behold thou
didst call my name! Wast thou dreaming of me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Little Cassia! I had a vision that some fateful
Power was bearing thee away, and as we were separated
thou didst stretch out thy hands imploringly toward
me. What meaneth the vision? Is it that we must
part?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O Saulus! Knowest thou not that it was but an idle
dream?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But thou only canst interpret it. Behold, O little
Cassia, thy image abideth in my soul. I love thee!
Wouldst thou be parted from me? Does another possess
thy heart? Heaven grant that my fears have been idle
concerning thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
Cassia, with her pale face full in the moonlight, and
her large eyes bedewed like morning flowers, listened as
he poured out his heart. At length her lips moved.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Saulus! I love no one else! Throughout all thy
absence thou hast been dear to me! Thy image hath
been enshrined in my soul! My dear Saulus</q>—but her
emotion was too powerful for further words.
</p>

<p>
She bent her bright young face upon his shoulder, and
the feeling that her love was now free to show itself was
<pb n="159"/><anchor id="Pg159"/>like the breaking of a great barrier. Her voice was
choked, and her heart beat wildly.
</p>

<p>
Saulus put his arm gently around her light form, and
looking up, said,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Heaven bless the day when first I saw thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
The orb of night hath looked down upon many such
scenes among the children of men.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
There was a few moments of silence, for the overcharged
souls were too full for utterance. Happiness,
sweet and irresistible, unchangeable and forever, was assured.
The shining firmament above their heads was
now echoing a great benediction, and the dread vision of
an hour before had dissolved and was forgotten. Nothing
henceforth could rend such a cementing of affection.
They were one in love, motive, and religion; and there
was but a single dream of the future. At length the agitation
with which their souls had been surcharged was
calmed, and a mystical and indescribable repose was
borne in upon them. Not merely their own hearts, but
the silvery sheen of the moonlight upon them, the still
night air around them, yea, the whole universe, spoke of
love; and there was no other language.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
Not until they were about to part did their thoughts
descend to things mundane, or even to the stirring religious
events of the day, or those which the morrow might
bring forth.
</p>

<p>
<q>I had delight in thy valiant defence of our holy religion
in the synagogue,</q> said Cassia. <q>I watched thee
<pb n="160"/><anchor id="Pg160"/>through the lattice, and rejoiced in every word thou didst
utter. I am exalted to possess the love of one who is so
loyal to our people. Thou art strong to bring the false
teachers and all our enemies to naught.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am doubly rewarded by thy favor in my chosen
work.</q>
</p>

<p>
Changed was the world, religion, life, and the future
to both at the close of that evening upon the house-top.

<l>“Roomy Eternity</l>
<l>Casts her schemes rarely,</l>
<l>And an æon allows</l>
<l>For each quality and part</l>
<l>Of the multitudinous</l>

<p>
The spread of the New Faith, and the hold that it took
upon increasing numbers of the common people of the
Holy City, furnishes a wonderful illustration of the inner
power of a simple, spiritual religion. Its purity and
depth were outwardly manifested by the general subordination
among its followers of the strongest of all
human passions,—selfishness. They were so filled with
the spirit of brotherhood that they counted it a privilege
to put their possessions into the common stock, in order
to give to each one as he had need. There was no
forced or legal communism, but a voluntary local and
temporary dominance of the great future human Ideal.
The law of the inherent blessedness of giving out—whether
of spiritual or material treasure—was practically
realized, and the harmonizing and uplifting power
of a true reciprocity proven. The exercise of a helpful
ministry marked a real nobility and greatness, and its
activities of relief and healing make up a unique epoch
in human history.
</p>

<pb n="162"/><anchor id="Pg162"/>

<p>
Wherever religion has dropped from simplicity and
spirituality, and become scholastic, dogmatic, ceremonial,
or a matter of the State, it has lost its power to
mould life, and heal the weaknesses and disorders of
mind and body. With almost no organization, system,
or theology, there was a dynamic quality among the
primitive believers, the phenomena of which are worthy
of the study of every one who would fathom the divine
economy of man. A gospel, or <q>Godspel,</q> was manifested.
The joy and gladness which came from a demonstration
of the practical working of the divine spirit
in humanity was the natural fruit of a release from the
shackles of a dead ceremonialism. It was a spontaneous
outburst of what before had been within, but
latent.
</p>

<p>
The divine, unchangeable Perfection had not changed
or improved in the <q>pouring out</q> of the Spirit, but human
receptivity was newly and voluntarily opened. Religion,
as a spiritual life, introduces a practical oneness
with, and re-enforcement of, divinity in man, which fruits
in <q>wonderful works</q> as a natural and orderly articulation.
The bestowment of spiritual favor on the Godward
side can never be less than full and perfect, else
would there be variableness and uncertainty. Law,
which is divine method, is as reliable in the spiritual
as the material realm; and the same compliance with its
orderly activity and employment will forever bring like
results. The <q>signs that follow them who believe</q> will
never fail, but belief in this sense signifies a spiritual
understanding deeper than mere intellectual assent. A
renewal of the marvellous <q>works</q> of the Primitive
<pb n="163"/><anchor id="Pg163"/>Church will come whenever a like spiritual dominance
over external conditions is gained. Chronology changes
no law of Being. The divine economy, being eternally
perfect, is not subject to the wavering moods of human
vacillation. They must conform to it, and not it to
them. Then, as man comes into at-one-ment with divine
laws and forces, he is backed by their energy, and commands
their accomplishments. The New Dispensation
was new only to the awareness of man. The variation
of personal standpoint makes a seeming movement of
the whole divine Order.
</p>

<p>
Serenus had been long ripening for the conditions
which came into outward exercise so spontaneously
among the primitive believers. In the earlier part of
his life, while among the Essenes and Therapeutæ, he
had witnessed much of the power which is linked to
spiritual devotion, and participated measurably in it.
His transparent character and inner development, with
the active exercise of a healing ministry, had marked
him as rare in attainment while young in years. But
during his connection with the school of Gamaliel, these
qualities were somewhat quiescent, while a more distinctive
intellectual development was taking place. But
under the influence of the new movement his spiritual
forces came to the front in full measure. He was everywhere
active in healing the sick, strengthening the weak,
instructing the ignorant, and sowing the seed for a spiritual
harvest. His miracles of healing came from an
intelligent wielding of the divine potencies, which, unrecognized
and latent, dwell in the inmost of every
human <q>image of God.</q>
</p>

<pb n="164"/><anchor id="Pg164"/>

<p>
In the early morning of the day after the meeting in
the Cyrenian synagogue, there was a street parade of
Roman legionaries, as was usual at short intervals, that
the people of Jerusalem might have constantly before
their eyes the tokens of imperial dominion. The imposing
military column started from the Tower of Antonia,
and after marching around a long circuit, passed through
the Square of the Sheepmarket on its return. Most of
the Jews, especially the better classes, resolutely kept
out of sight, with every portal and window closed, as the
hated Romans passed by. But to the rabble, music and
pageantry were attractive. The blare of trumpets signalled
their approach. In advance was a vanguard of
spearmen, with gilded helmets, mailed breastplates, and
shields upon the left arm, marching with a rhythm so
perfect that they seemed like a huge machine, working
with automatic regularity and perfection. The bronzed
faces, brown, muscular limbs, and mailed armor, with
their exact mechanical swing, made them seem more
like men of iron than of flesh. Then came the ensigns,
with banners and pennants floating in air, and in their
midst, upon a tall rod, an emblematic gilded eagle with
outstretched wings. Next were bowmen and slingers in
close column of ranks and files, stretching out far in
the distance. Then a group of mounted officers, commanders
of cohorts, and centurions with a guard, and
long array of cavalry, all speaking eloquently of the
heavy mailed hand of Cæsar. The huzzas of the soldiers
were often answered by the hisses and sneers of
the onlookers, but outbreaks were not frequent. But as
they passed the inn of the Sheepmarket, Rabbi Abdiel
<pb n="165"/><anchor id="Pg165"/>looked down upon them from the roof, and with a sudden
impulse raised his arms toward heaven, and in a loud
voice called down upon the moving mass the curses of
Jehovah. At first the soldiers gave no attention to his
maledictions except to send up a few jeers and shouts
of derision; but as he continued, a centurion below
gave an order to a rank of soldiers,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Enter and seize the Jewish dog! To the Tower with
him!</q>
</p>

<p>
This was done, and the location of the offending inn
noted. But there was no halt of the long, glittering column,
which continued its winding march until it passed
over the great drawbridge, and was lost to sight as it
entered the broad frowning portal of Antonia.
</p>

<p>
Upon his return, the Commandant of the Tower found
a little deputation awaiting him with a petition. They
were members of the congregation of the New Faith, who
having heard that a tumult was probable at the Cyrenian
synagogue, and that the young deacon Stephanos was in
danger, asked for the protection of the Roman authorities.
The request was heard, but refused, and they were
flippantly dismissed.
</p>

<p>
<q>By Bacchus!</q> said the Commandant. <q>We are not
here to take account of all your hair-splitting religious
quarrels and tumults. We understand them not, and have
no care for them so long as Cæsar’s prerogatives are
unquestioned. Fight out your own differences! Your
petition doth not concern us!</q>
</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p>
At a later hour the meeting at the synagogue was to
take place. Long before the time, the room was crowded
<pb n="166"/><anchor id="Pg166"/>to the utmost, and a dense throng gathered in the streets
outside. There was an air of unwonted excitement and
expectation. Wild rumors had flown thick and fast, that
Stephanos would boldly attack the whole ceremonial system,
and that there was a strong faction organized for
resistance. It was said that if he offended they might
forcibly bring him before the Sanhedrin, which would be
in special session.
</p>

<p>
The meeting opened. Stephanos arose calmly, and,
after reading a few passages from the prophets, began
his address,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Brethren and friends! Again with joy I proclaim
unto you the first fruits of the New Dispensation of the
Spirit of Truth. The Word of the Lord is increased;
and mighty works, signs, and ministries are being wrought
in our midst. From out of the dead works of your ordinances
and traditions there has sprung a New Faith,
even that proclaimed by the Nazarene, who rebuked your
hypocrisy, and laid the foundation of an unseen and universal
spiritual kingdom. Lo! as he hath prophesied,
the Spirit is <q>poured out,</q> and many not of the Levitical
order are inspired to teach and preach.</q>
</p>

<p>
As Stephanos continued, he waxed eloquent, and spake
with great vigor. It seemed not to be the young man
himself who was speaking, but some mighty power which
was manifested through him. A Spirit was within which
was so intense that it shone through his face, and his
words were so powerful that his hearers were spellbound.
</p>

<p>
But the spell was broken by a signal which was at
once followed by a fierce rush upon the platform. The
bustling form of Saulus, with fiery face, flashing eyes,
<pb n="167"/><anchor id="Pg167"/>and clinched fists, was in the midst; and above the noise
of the uproar his loud voice echoed through the synagogue,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Seize the traitor! Down with the blasphemer! Drag
him out! To the Sanhedrin! To the Sanhedrin!</q>
</p>

<p>
The members of the Society of the <foreign rend="italic">Urim</foreign> were in the
forefront; and besides, there had gathered a rabble from
the streets who were eager to join the mob. A little
band of the disciples of the New Faith clustered about
Stephanos with devoted and loving faithfulness, but acted
only as a defensive shield, and were soon borne down by
the force and ferocity of greatly superior numbers. Amid
wild shouts and confusion the little band was scattered,
and Stephanos seized and taken out of the synagogue.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ha! Where is the great kingdom? Hath it been
set up? Where is its throne?</q> said Saulus. <q>We shall
make short work of thee and all thy kind! Come on,
witnesses! To the Sanhedrin! To the Sanhedrin!</q>
</p>

<p>
Stephanos was dragged up the steep road to the <q>Hall
of Squares,</q> where the august court was in session. On
the way he made no resistance, and amid jeers, savage
yells, and curses, was led along. With loud commands,
Saulus headed the throng.
</p>

<p>
The seventy-one members of the Sanhedrin were seated
at the farther end of the spacious hall, in tiers of seats
rising from the centre, and sweeping around in an imposing
semicircle. Annas was High Priest and presiding
officer on this occasion. They had been apprised of the
fact that Stephanos would be brought before them, and
were ready to receive him. He was led in by Saulus
and the witnesses; as many of the throng following as
<pb n="168"/><anchor id="Pg168"/>could find room in the public part of the hall. Everything
was ready, and pointed to a foregone conclusion.
The charges were made; and the witnesses stood up, one
by one, to confront and make testimony against their
victim.
</p>

<p>
<q>I heard him speak against the Holy Place, and blaspheme
the Law.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I heard him declare that the doctrine of the Nazarene
would destroy the Temple service, and do away with the
Law of Moses.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I heard him say that he despised our sacred traditions
and ordinances.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I heard him call our chief priests and Rabbis hypocrites,
and speak of a new kingdom not of the Chosen
People.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I heard him proclaim the Messiahship of the Galilean
pretender, and blaspheme Jehovah.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I heard him speak against the Circumcision, and call
the Nazarene the Son of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then the High Priest, clothed in the imposing robes
of his office, arose, and waving his hand, asked Stephanos
to plead by answering the formal and customary question,
<q>Are these things so?</q>
</p>

<p>
Stephanos arose to make answer. Young, handsome,
and tall, with dignified manner, he wore an unwonted
grandeur in looks, words, and action. He began an eloquent
oration. As he proceeded, he seemed transfigured
by an inner consciousness which fairly illumined his
countenance. He looked his accusers in the face, and
they quailed before him. Even the fevered and fierce
glance of Saulus was cast down when the penetrating
<pb n="169"/><anchor id="Pg169"/>look of the saint was turned upon him. A marvellous
inner light shone out through his face, which entirely
transformed its expression. It was heavenly, rather than
defiant, but to the onlookers it was awful. While it
radiated love and spiritual exaltation, to them it was
threatening and terrible. Overshadowed by the Shekinah,
there was an intangible halo about him, in which
they saw mirrored their own guilt and condemnation.
As he continued, a raging passion boiled in their hearts,
even though for a time they were spellbound. His
amazing courage and stinging truthfulness were paralyzing,
and they could no longer look upon that terrible
face.
</p>

<p>
At length Stephanos stopped short in his unanswerable
argument, and there was a moment of silence.
Then he gathered up the full measure of his righteous
wrath, and hurled it in their indignant but shrinking
faces. He denounced them as betrayers and murderers,
and lashed them with invective, terrible but true. Then
the awful spell was broken, and their pent-up hatred
burst all bonds. The wonted sedate and dignified Sanhedrin
exploded with anger. Unable longer to maintain
any semblance of judicial procedure, they waxed hot,
gnashed their teeth, clinched their fists, and hissed and
howled like wild beasts.
</p>

<p>
Traitor! Blasphemer! Slanderer! Reprobate! Heretic!
were some of the names that were hurled at Stephanos
from all directions. He was not abashed, but the burst
of holy indignation which had gone forth from him was
ended. It was aimed at their actions and customs rather
than themselves. Though severe, it was not vindictive
<pb n="170"/><anchor id="Pg170"/>or intended for insult, but awakening. But reason was
unavailing. Righteousness is a standing menace and
rebuke to guilt. Nothing can be more hateful.
</p>

<p>
Stephanos lifted his eyes from the malignant faces,
rendered demoniacal by surging passion, and looked up
as if in a trance. The Sanhedrin, with all its bitterness,
faded from his sight, and became to him as though
it were not. An ecstasy was upon him, and he saw a
beatific vision. While the human wild beasts around
him growled and thirsted for his blood, his eyes were
fastened upon a realm of eternal peace, harmony, and
glory. His sublime and all-powerful faith ushered him
into the kingdom of the Real, while the temporary and
incidental shrank to their relative nothingness.
</p>

<p>
The Sanhedrin regarded itself as eminent, respectable,
and humane, but its members were utterly unable to
cognize the truth that was clear and open to Stephanos.
To them their anger was a righteous anger, which exercised
itself in the service of Jehovah. The psychological
wave of rage swept every member of the Jewish High
Court off his feet, and bore him on. But were they sinners
above other men? History before and since teems
with like transactions, among all nations, and in the
name of all religions.
</p>

<p>
Stephanos had spoken against things which were sacred
and infallible. It was not alone his burning eloquence,
but its terrible truth, that cut them to the heart
and made their blood boil. But now his animate body
was yet in their midst, but <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was no longer there. He
was listening to a heavenly harmony, and not to a deafening
clamor. Expecting him to continue, they had
<pb n="171"/><anchor id="Pg171"/>stopped their ears to shut out his polluting blasphemy.
Then, with one impulse, they arose in a mass, and rushed
upon him. Their decision was spontaneous, and without
any legal formality or deliberation. They dragged
him away to be stoned outside the city gate. The spirit
of persecution transformed the dignified Sanhedrin into
a revengeful mob.
</p>

<p>
Saulus prompted the witnesses when they gave testimony,
and when the explosion occurred was among the
foremost. In the rush that was made from the hall to
the street his diminutive form was at the front, and with
glowing face and violent gestures he urged on their impetuous
movement. As they passed along the streets
toward the Damascus Gate, they were joined by great
masses of excited men, women, and children. Stephanos
made no resistance. Shouts and imprecations filled the
air. The members of the New Faith, being few in number
and non-resistant in their philosophy of living,
made no opposition. No herald preceded him to proclaim
his name and crime as was usual in regular cases
of legal condemnation. No bitter draft containing
frankincense to stupefy the senses, and take away the
edge of pain and terror, was administered, and none was
needed. Stephanos could not suffer; for he was already
in the midst of spiritual liberty, joy, and peace. The
seething mob hurried his animate form along, and passed
out to the north of the city to a piece of open ground
on the border of the valley of Jehoshaphat.
</p>

<p>
Stephanos calmly kneeled down without being bound
or fastened, still looking up and beholding a vision of
glory. His upper garments were stripped off; and then,
<pb n="172"/><anchor id="Pg172"/>for the first time, a regular proceeding was observed, in
that the witnesses were to cast the first stones. At length
all was ready, and for a moment there was a silence which
was oppressive. Stretching out his hands toward his
murderers, he besought from above their forgiveness, and
gave them his benediction. The stillness continued, the
witnesses were spellbound, and the throng awed and immovable.
The supreme grandeur and spiritual beauty
that shone through his face dazzled and benumbed them,
and almost deterred them from their purpose. There
was a visible shrinking, and each waited for the other to
make the first move. But Saulus sprang forth and broke
the spell. With frantic manner and loud voice, he
cried,—
</p>

<p>
<q>To your work, O witnesses! Finish the Blasphemer!
Heresy must be crushed! Hand me your garments that
nothing may encumber, and cursed be he who holds
back.</q>
</p>

<p>
The tragedy was soon ended.
</p>

<lg>
<l>The body sank to earth, its resting-place;</l>
<l>Not so the man. He lives to truth and right.</l>
<l>He flung behind all strife, and in the race</l>
<l>Mounts on and up, though lost to mortal sight.</l>
</lg>

<p>
The crowd soon melted away; and many seemed fearful,
oppressed, and ashamed of their part in the transaction.
Even those members of the Sanhedrin who had
accompanied the throng were troubled in spirit, and
made haste to get away. But Saulus was undaunted,
and returned exultant and proud. He made his way
back to the Sheepmarket; but the news had preceded
<pb n="173"/><anchor id="Pg173"/>him, and as he entered the inn he received the congratulations
of all except Rebecca.
</p>

<p>
In the evening of the same day the little group met in
the court as was wont. Rabbi Abdiel was of the number,
having been released from the Tower.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thy day’s work hath been well done,</q> said the venerable
Jew. <q>We would that such things need not be,
but heresy must be destroyed. Mercy to our people and
their precious traditions demands that false doctrine be
uprooted, and that without remedy. Such is the will of
the Lord.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am persuaded that this pestilent delusion must be
put down at once,</q> replied Saulus, <q>or peradventure
it will spread beyond all bounds. I shall take up the
work with power, and the High Priest and the whole
Sanhedrin will give me all authority. I glory in the
effectual door that is open unto me whereby I may do
such service.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>These are tumultuous days,</q> said Benoni. <q>I had
not believed that my eyes would behold such things in
the Holy City, but anon they wax worse and worse. But
it is expedient that thou continue as thou hast begun.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold, O son of Benoni! thou art chosen from
among our people to lead in this great service,</q> said
Almon.
</p>

<p>
<q>It behooveth me to bring this conspiracy to naught,
and I shall lose no time in its discomfiture.</q>
</p>

<p>
Rebecca drew her brother aside, and putting her arm
about him, softly said,—
</p>

<p>
<q>O my Saulus! I am persuaded that the young son of
Israel who saved me from the throng on the day of
Pente<pb n="174"/><anchor id="Pg174"/>cost would condemn this day’s proceeding! Remember
he called himself <q>the friend of Saulus.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Did he belong to the sect of the Nazarene, or speak
well of it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold I wot not how that may be, but he was so
kind and noble that I feel he would have none of persecution!
O Saulus! must you continue this business?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou deceivest thyself,</q> said Saulus, with an impatient
gesture. <q>The man is no friend of mine, and if
he be a follower of the Nazarene he will suffer with the
rest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O Saulus! I pray that he may be spared. Behold
the favor which he showed me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I say unto thee I know him not; and if he be a heretic,
woe be to him!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall try to find him out and warn him!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It would be well for thee, Rebecca, to leave the Holy
City, and seek thy home in Tarsus!</q>
</p>

<p>
Saulus petulantly turned away, and passed out of the
court-yard.
</p>

<p>
Cassia was waiting in the passage, and sped to give
him congratulation.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Saulus! thou art noble and brave!</q> she exclaimed,
embracing him. <q>I glory in thy courage and service.
Behold I love thee even more than I was wont!</q>
</p>

<p>
Saulus returned the warm greeting.
</p>

<p>
<q>Cassia, love, I have great joy in thy favor. I live
for thee!</q> Then grasping her small hand he gave it
a warm kiss, and hastened to his chamber.
</p>

<p>
In the solitude of his room and stillness of the night,
he sat down to review the events of the day. His
exhil<pb n="175"/><anchor id="Pg175"/>aration, and even the indorsement and congratulation of
his friends, gradually seemed to vanish, and he was almost
forced to look within and become more familiar
with himself. He was surprised at the clearness and
depth of the picture of the scene of the day which seemed
to be burnt into his very soul. The tragedy beyond the
city wall stood out before him in every detail. The
throng, the shouts, his own share, the murderous act of
the witnesses, the kneeling victim, his entreaty of pardon
for his slayers, all riveted his attention as keenly as
when they were taking place. It was as though his mind
had been a tablet of stone, with the whole scene deeply
chiselled in characters which could never be erased
or hidden.
</p>

<p>
<q>The duty of the day is done, and well done,</q> he
said to himself; <q>and now I will have rest. I bid farewell
to this event, that I may be well prepared to continue
the warfare to-morrow.</q>
</p>

<p>
But it would not depart.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay, begone! I would not live it over more to-night.</q>
</p>

<p>
But it became more obtrusive than ever.
</p>

<p>
Thinking to divert his mind, he took a roll containing
a copy of the <q>Mishna,</q> with its six hundred and thirteen
precepts, and began to read them slowly in order.
But even upon the roll, in the midst of the clearly inscribed
lines which recited the Jewish code, there was
the scene, the tragedy! He impatiently threw down the
roll, and in the stillness seemed to hear a voice within.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou art guilty! Thy peace hath forsaken thee!
Thou art condemned! condemned! condemned!</q>
</p>

<pb n="176"/><anchor id="Pg176"/>

<p>
He was startled, for the voice was so distinct that it
seemed to come to the outer hearing. He stopped his
ears to find if it were still audible.
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend="italic">Condemned! condemned! condemned!</hi></q> still echoed as
before.
</p>

<p>
He arose and walked to and fro, and made audible
answer.
</p>

<p>
<q>Cease thy railing! I am the defender of my people!
I will fight blasphemy and heresy, and nothing shall
hinder! The Chosen People will honor me! Away,
and be thou choked, thou false and lying spirit! I
crush thee, and will increase my deeds manifold!</q>
</p>

<p>
He then extinguished his lamp, and retired to his
couch for the night. But his sleep was broken, and he
could not rest. He heard angry voices, groans, and
noises, and saw horrible shapes. But at length, in the
midst of a troubled sleep, he was suddenly awakened.
Something seemed to have shaken him. With a shiver
through every nerve, he sat upright, and saw a bright
object in the blackness before him. His gaze was fastened,
and he could not turn it aside.
</p>

<p>
<q>Away! Away! Trouble me not!</q>
</p>

<p>
But the brightness remained, and soon began to transform
itself. Feature after feature came into distinct
outline. It was a shining face. Calm, luminous, and
grand, it gazed steadily upon him. His blood froze in
his veins as he recognized the <hi rend="italic">glorified face</hi> of <hi rend="smallcaps">Stephanos</hi>.

<head>CHAPTER XVIII<lb/>AMABEL’S REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE</head>

<p>
Amabel returned to her father’s palace in a state of
great disquietude. The unexpected meeting with Serenus,
but vastly more its unwonted circumstances, gave
her a great shock. What could it mean? Serenus walking
the streets of the Holy City in the company of a
young woman, a stranger, in a manner which betokened
great familiarity! Such an event, witnessed by her own
eyes, shook and threatened to disenthrone her Ideal, and
to dissolve everything which she had counted solid and
sacred.
</p>

<p>
Since Amabel’s last interview with Serenus, she had
striven loyally to banish his image from her mind, but
with variable success. At times she almost seemed to
feel his presence, and in other moods persuaded herself
that she was quite resigned to the inevitable and final
separation which had been wisely accepted by both.
</p>

<p>
Amabel was an idolized favorite in the Holy City.
Her grace and beauty, with the eminent position of the
Rabban, gave her the highest social distinction. Who
so happy as Amabel? The centre of an admiring circle,
the petted daughter of tender parents, surrounded by luxury,
active in kindly deeds, and loyal to her religion,
what more could be desired? But a heaviness was in
<pb n="178"/><anchor id="Pg178"/>her heart, and the world about her was prosaic and mechanical.
Her social and religious duties were faithfully
performed, and she enjoyed the favor and love of all;
but, alas, a worm was gnawing at the root of a comely
flower. There was a subtle unrest and secret blight that
made life barren and joyless. She became introspective,
and often tried to weigh her motives, obstacles, and aspirations,
as in a pair of balances.
</p>

<p>
The Is and the Might Be are always coming up for
comparison and contrast in the human foreground. On
one side, Amabel had home, friends, social position, and
the accepted religion of her own people, and on the
other, Serenus, his love, and a New Faith which seemed
strange to her. Although Serenus had assured her of his
devoted and undying affection, he had not asked or expected
that she would renounce all for him. He had
taken it for granted that she would not and could not.
He had gracefully accepted the stern logic of the situation,
and cheerfully made the great sacrifice. On her
part, she had even withheld the confession of her own
love, for the sole purpose of making his burden lighter,
and his renunciation possible. As they <hi rend="italic">must</hi> separate, it
would be easier so.
</p>

<p>
Since the evening of the earnest avowal of love by
Serenus, and the mutual acquiescence in the imperative
separation, life had drifted along; but the whole world
was changed. Her cheeks had lost their color, and
there were many evidences of wearing preoccupation.
But she made a heroic effort to fall into the current of
what was expected of her, and firmly resolved to cease
all iridescent dreaming, and be resigned.
</p>

<pb n="179"/><anchor id="Pg179"/>

<p>
After the chance meeting, Amabel arrived at home
almost breathless, and avoiding the family, hastened to
her favorite nook upon the house-top. Her heart was
fluttering, her senses swimming, and she must have a
little time. It was all important that she rally her
forces, and lift herself above the sudden rush of waves
which threatened to ingulf her. She began to reason
with herself, and to cast about for some solid ground
upon which she might stand. She could not interpret
her own soul. There were two voices within, and each
claimed her. Admitting her love for Serenus, had not
all forever been settled between them?
</p>

<p>
But was there <hi rend="italic">another</hi>?
</p>

<p>
<q>What have <hi rend="italic">I</hi> to do with another? Have we not
parted forever! Ought not I to rejoice even in his happiness
with <hi rend="italic">another</hi>? Oh, my heart! I cannot understand
thee! Thou seemest not to reason, but to feel!</q>
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
<q>I could bear parting, did I but know that I was thy
sole possession! Nay, were I never more to behold thy
face, I could rest content as <hi rend="italic">thine</hi>! thine in the unseen!
thine forever! But <hi rend="italic">another</hi>! Be still, heart! I will not
doubt him! I am divided in myself! I doubt him, and
cannot doubt him! Now, I am decided! I thrust out
that image of another! I see only thee! Often when all
was still, I have heard the tones of thy sweet voice! The
sunrise and the sunset have been laden with the brightness
of thy lofty soul! In my dreams I wander with
thee, not upon the hard and dusty paths of earth, but in
the ambient air, and beyond the clouds! I need not see
<pb n="180"/><anchor id="Pg180"/>thee with mortal eyes in order to mount by thy side, and
command the range of created things!</q>
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
<q>Away! That cruel vision again forces itself upon
me! Not that I wish her ill! But there can be but <hi rend="italic">one</hi>!
Down, hateful thoughts! I will not doubt him! But is
it anything, now that we are separated? Everything!
We are together, though apart! Even beyond the grave
will we commune with each other! Ah! then it were
sweet, even to die!</q>
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
<q>The ebb and flow of my heart is unto thee! Crowds
that flatter and would serve me pass by, but only thou
art near me! O Future! art thou ours together? Back!
that dark vision haunts me again! I would not, I will
not behold it!</q>
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
The thick curtains of night had been drawn, and Amabel
was missing. The household of Gamaliel began to
be apprehensive; but bethinking themselves of her favorite
resort, ascended to look for her, believing she might
have fallen asleep. Her prostrate form was found in a
state of feverish unconsciousness. Kind hands bore her
tenderly below, and loving hearts exercised themselves
in every form of devoted ministration. Her body was
motionless, except that her lips were moved in an incoherent
muttering. The skill of the physicians was exerted
to the utmost to arouse her, but hour after hour
passed without any visible change. Her illness was
<pb n="181"/><anchor id="Pg181"/>found to be a violent fever in the head, and it was whispered
that peradventure it was beyond the reach of the
healing art. But however it might end, it would be long
and desperate.
</p>

<p>
By the next morning Amabel’s condition was somewhat
changed. She moved restlessly upon her couch,
and had recurring intervals of consciousness, but the
burning fever was continuous. She begged for water
and fresh air, both of which were denied her except in
very sparing quantities, for fear of harm. Strong medicaments,
of a quality which produced disgust and loathing,
were faithfully administered, but no healing effect
was manifest.
</p>

<p>
How futile and superficial the devices of the healing
art, in any and all ages, in its attempts to deal with
maladies of the soul! And who will declare that the
deep and obscure fountain of all ailments is not located
in the unseen and immaterial part! Verily the springs
of man’s nature are hidden, while seen and secondary
manifestation is upon the surface, being resultant.
</p>

<p>
Weary days and nights dragged their slow course
along. At length the violence of the fever abated, but
the pale face and wasted form spoke eloquently of the
vanity of human effort in her behalf. Her glassy eyes
and sunken cheeks proclaimed an impending collapse of
the mortal tenement. The pure white soul was nearing
the portal of the earthly tabernacle, apparently soon to
step out.
</p>

<p>
The physicians solemnly announced that the end was
not far away, and that it could not be averted. As a
weary toiler at the close of day lays down the instrument
<pb n="182"/><anchor id="Pg182"/>he has wielded, so the daughter of the Rabban must put
aside that seen counterpart which no longer could serve
her.
</p>

<p>
Gamaliel was bowed with grief. When not at the bedside
of his daughter, he seemed dazed, and was barely
able to bear the mechanical round of his daily duties.
Was the sweet flower of his family to be uprooted? the
light of his <anchor id="corr182"/><corr sic="houshold">household</corr> to go out?
</p>

<lg>
<l>Embowered awhile so tenderly in hearts of love,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like some pure gem, enclosed so safe in setting rare,</l>
<l>The tenement outgrown, and now the soul would move,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And mount to larger life within a realm more fair.</l>
</lg>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
These were days of sombre stillness in the palace of
Gamaliel. The birth-pains of a soul, as it passes into
the higher life, are more outside than within. Everything
around is smitten and takes up a plaint, even when
the soul that goes is quickened, and its own path
smoothed and lighted.
</p>

<p>
Intervals of calmness and delirium alternated in their
possession of Amabel. Her frame became so thin and
transparent that the flashes of the pulsating self seemed
to shine through, and reveal its vital dominance. But
her incoherent utterances during periods of aberration,
though very weak, gradually became more distinct.
</p>

<p>
<q>Serenus! Serenus!</q> was plainly upon her lips. It
was repeated again and again. This was made known
to Gamaliel. He was a wise father and a prudent interpreter.
He thought deeply upon the matter; and after a
brief but sharp conflict in his own mind between parental
<pb n="183"/><anchor id="Pg183"/>love and official dignity, the former prevailed, and he
sat down and wrote a hasty letter.
</p>

<p><text><body>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">O Serenus! my friend and former helper! Peace be unto
thee! Knowing well thy noble spirit and wise prudence, I pray
for thy kind favor in my affliction. Touching a request that I
make unto thee, my heart is rent with sorrow, in that my dear
Amabel is soon to depart from our midst. She hath a deadly
disorder, so that her days with us are nearly ended. And now
I have to inform thee that, in her moments of sleep or wandering,
she speaketh of thee and calleth thy name. Peradventure
thy presence might soothe her, and bring peace to her troubled
soul. While we mourn her as already dead, we pray that her
closing hours may be serene. I am persuaded that past events
have not clouded thy friendly spirit, and therefore beseech thy
presence with us. The God of Israel bless thee! In sore
affliction,</q>
</p>

<signed rend="text-align: right"><hi rend="smallcaps">Gamaliel</hi>.”</signed>
</body></text></p>

<p>
The breast of Serenus was rent with conflicting emotions
as he laid down the letter. Mingled with his sorrow
at the sad tidings about Amabel, there was even a
note of gladness. <q>She loves me!</q> was the thought
that echoed and re-echoed through his heart. <q>If her
seen form is to vanish, <hi rend="italic">she</hi> is not the visible, but the invisible,
and love is eternal. The grave can rear no wall
nor make no gulf between us. Behold we dwell here for
a season in tents, and then quietly fold them and move
forward. Poor Amabel! She loveth me, but hid her love
that she might not increase my burden.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But the sad tidings of the letter hath made me
un<pb n="184"/><anchor id="Pg184"/>mindful of my faith! Why should <hi rend="italic">I</hi> consent to the declaration
that Amabel must pass from sight? What have
<hi rend="italic">I</hi> to do with the faithlessness of the world? nay, even of
the ceremonial religionist? What do the physicians,
who are persuaded that her life must go out, understand
of the vital powers of the spirit? Their nauseous medicaments
touch but the utmost surface of life’s visible expression.
They wot not of its hidden springs, and how
to take hold upon them! Even the eyes of Gamaliel,
master in Israel though he be, are not opened to the
Father’s helpfulness! Did not the prophet of Nazareth
declare, <q>These signs shall follow them that believe</q>?
Behold neither the world nor the church doth believe!
Have I not witnessed wonderful works among the Essenes
and Therapeutæ? nay, are they not now common in the
household of the New Faith? Is not the life of God in
all things? and hath not every one that measure of it
which he will open his soul to receive? Behold the
Father withholdeth not, for all things are freely given to
his children. His abounding spirit of wholeness is waiting
to fill every place which is made meet!</q>
</p>

<p>
Such were some of the thoughts that flashed through
the mind of Serenus. While at first taken unawares, and
cast down by the tidings of Amabel’s condition, he soon
felt a mighty influx of faith and strength that filled him
with spiritual energy. Nothing was impossible!
</p>

<p>
<q>Can Amabel be inspired with such a faith? And
behold her friends live not in the spirit, but in doctrines
and traditions! The eyes of them of the outer kingdom
are holden! Who can persuade them to come to themselves?</q>
</p>

<pb n="185"/><anchor id="Pg185"/>

<p>
<q>O Amabel! innocent but weak! untaught, and a
stranger to truth! is there time to bring inspiration into
thy life so that thy belief of a speedy departure may be
uprooted? As thou thinkest, so will it come to pass.</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus lost no time in making his way to the palace,
and was softly ushered into Amabel’s presence. His
face betokened peace, yea, even commanding power.
Knew he not that infinite forces were back of him? Yea,
they were familiar, and by orderly method he would
wield them!
</p>

<p>
Undaunted by the paleness and wasted proportions of
the fair form, so changed since he last beheld it, his face
almost shone at the thought of the privilege of spiritual
ministration. Shrunken, weak, and motionless, to the
outer eyes the life of Amabel, like a fitful flame, was
just ready to expire. Serenus seated himself near by.
Perchance she was dreaming, for soon there was a
movement of the lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>Serenus! Serenus!</q> was uttered in a distinct whisper,
but she had not yet opened her eyes. He heeded
not the sound of his name, but sat with bowed head in
perfect silence.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
A full half-hour passed, during which not a word was
spoken. The place seemed hallowed with an invisible
Presence. The gloom fled away before a brightness
which might almost be felt. The life of Amabel is a
part of the One Life, and knoweth neither limitation nor
death! Depart thou belief of mortality! Child of God!
thou art unseen spirit! It is thine to <hi rend="italic">rule</hi> the outer form,
<pb n="186"/><anchor id="Pg186"/>therefore, assert thy right, and it shall be subject to thy
behest! Thou art divine in thy being, and all good is
thy free heritage.
</p>

<p>
Silence still prevailed.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
At length Amabel opened her eyes, and beheld the face
of Serenus.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Serenus! art thou here? I was dreaming of thy
presence. I have prayed to see thee once more before
my departure.</q>
</p>

<p>
These words were spoken in a low, sweet voice; the
first above a whisper for three days. She continued,—
</p>

<p>
<q>My hours are numbered! I now can tell thee of my
love. While I had life before me it was expedient that
I should refrain. Blessed be these eyes which once more
behold thee! Abiding peace be thine!</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus lightly took her thin and almost transparent
hand, and bending his head, touched it softly to his lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>Amabel! there is an abundance of life, and to spare.
Behold the very breath of God is within you! His
strength is freely and lovingly thine own.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How sayest thou so, Serenus? Behold it hath been
told me that I must die. The physicians have so declared,
and my parents mourn me as though already
departed. Thinkest thou that there is life beyond the
grave, and is it that of which thou speakest? And does
love continue there?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O Amabel! there is no grave, save for worn-out dust.
Thy fair form is yet youthful, and thou mayst command
it as thou wilt, and enjoy its sweet ministry.</q>
</p>

<pb n="187"/><anchor id="Pg187"/>

<p>
<q>What is that thou sayest? Behold many of fewer
years than mine are gathered unto their fathers!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, the <hi rend="italic">belief</hi> in the power of the grave hath passed
upon the children of men. But they know not the power
of God, and how it is given to his children to wield it if
they will. As we open our souls, and confidently take
hold of the Present Help, strength is ours. Be filled
with the spirit of the Father, for he is thy dwelling-place.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O glorious tidings! I feel thrilled in soul and
body!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou hast new life already! Hail with joy the Universal
Good, and feel and affirm its presence <hi rend="italic">now</hi>!</q>
</p>

<p>
A tiny flame had been lighted in the darkness which
surrounds the tomb. May it increase! As Serenus took
his leave, Amabel showed unwonted calmness and brightness.
</p>

<p>
The day following witnessed a marvellous gain. The
change was so great as to cause rejoicing and wonder in
the palace. Amabel had remained free from unconscious
intervals, and though yet weak, was calm and cheerful.
Serenus came, and was warmly greeted.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Serenus! I am filled with new hope and joy that
I cannot understand. A voice within me seems to speak
words of life and strength. I have unwonted peace, yea,
even joy! Whence cometh it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Dear Amabel! the belief in the power of death hath
been vanquished. Life is thine, and an overcoming faith
hath quickened and filled thee.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Cometh it from the God of Israel, Serenus? Behold,
I saw thee bowed in silence yesterday, though I heard
<pb n="188"/><anchor id="Pg188"/>no words. Didst thou call upon him, and he send down
an answer?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou speakest of the God of Israel; but behold God
is the God of all peoples, and the whole earth. I made no
request that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> should become more willing, for nothing
is lacking on his part. But I realized for thee, that he,
being perfect Goodness, hath already answered every desire
for help. All change and conformity must be within
ourselves. They who are unbelieving, ignorantly pray
for that which is around them as free as the air of
heaven. The Father’s table is loaded for his children,
while they turn their backs upon it, and beseech him for
bread.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, O Serenus! while I feel new life, I cannot understand
how it can come unless it be sent.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>God is Spirit, and his tabernacle is not far away,
but <hi rend="italic">within</hi> his children. He is their Life, Love, and
Strength, and is in them, and they in him. When thou
dost understand the laws of thy being, behold these
things are multiplied, and thy soul and body have nourishment.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What a mystery that I had new strength yesterday,
before thou mad’st known these things to me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold the truth and faith which inspire may be
received by silent ministry from another. The Spirit
speaketh through one to another without words.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I marvel at what thou sayest!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>When one feeleth the image of God within him, its
still small voice of love and at-one-ment may go out to
his brother, and be heard by the inner ear, and anon its
fruits appear outwardly.</q>
</p>

<pb n="189"/><anchor id="Pg189"/>

<p>
<q>I would know this mighty truth more perfectly!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou hast always been Godlike in thine inner being,
but hast not known thy true self. Thine eyes have been
turned toward outward things, while the fountain of life
is within. All power is given unto thee in the measure
that thou dost claim and use it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold thou sayest that it is not I, but something
else that is within?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thy question indeed toucheth a great mystery.
Verily I interpret to thee, that the inner voice, Son or
Spirit, it is thy true self, while it is thine outer thoughts
which seemeth to be, and claimeth thee.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A mystery indeed! behold, how can I understand it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As we seek the truth and strive to feel it, it unveileth
itself. Man judgeth by appearances. Counting things
that are seen as the Real, we thereby deceive ourselves,
and our thoughts lead us astray. Behold our weaknesses
and sicknesses are the outworkings of our darkened and
troubled minds. If we dwell in the restless billows of
the outer and deceitful self, they submerge us. Righteousness
is right thinking, of which outward wholeness,
as well as good works, is the natural harvest.</q>
</p>

<p>
Light shone in upon the soul of Amabel.
</p>

<p>
Before Serenus departed, there was a long interval of
silent communion with the Universal Spirit. The two
pure souls unbarred the portals of their higher natures,
and the divine sunshine illumined every apartment. Each
was consciously enfolded by the Presence. There was no
trance or other unwonted manifestation, but simple <hi rend="italic">realization</hi>
of what <hi rend="italic">is</hi>. The children of men felt the loving
embrace of God.
</p>

<pb n="190"/><anchor id="Pg190"/>

<p>
Serenus continued his daily visits.
</p>

<p>
A week passed, and there was great joy in the household
over Amabel’s recovery. Her strength rapidly returned,
and all feebleness disappeared. Her cheeks
regained their wonted freshness; and the outshining of
her soul, through the large, speaking eyes, told of inner
peace and exuberant life. Her recovery astounded the
physicians, and her father was both puzzled and delighted.
He was persuaded that his own prayers to Jehovah must
have had efficacy, but his faith in the physicians as divinely
appointed means was sorely shaken. But he was
wise enough to perceive that his daughter loved Serenus,
and that peradventure his presence was so pleasing to
her that it had been helpful, but beyond that he saw
nothing. It was impossible for him to think other than
highly of the character of Serenus; but now, beholding
the devoted affection of Amabel, he bewailed his heresy
sorely. How could <hi rend="italic">he</hi>, the eminent Rabban, with the
eyes of all Judea upon him, ever sanction his deposed
assistant? and as for making him his son, his soul was
distressed at the thought. If Serenus was dear to him
in person, his doctrines and associates were most hateful.
He groaned in spirit, for Amabel was the idol of his
heart.
</p>

<p>
On the tenth day after his first visit, Serenus found
Amabel in her favorite nook upon the roof. It was a
balmy afternoon. The delicious atmosphere, not too
warm, was barely stirred by a gentle breeze, and the
Holy City never was more glorious and serene. The
great Temple seemed almost transparent in its dazzling
whiteness, and the clear air gave an unwonted nearness
<pb n="191"/><anchor id="Pg191"/>to the more distant mountains. Amabel was the ideal of
health, and there was an exquisite grace and purity in her
looks not equalled before her illness. Could those rosy
cheeks be the same that were so deathly pale and sunken
a few short days ago? Verily a new spirit maketh all
things new!<note place="foot">It may seem that healing as depicted in this case was very sudden; but
the recorded works of Peter, John, and many others, which took place during
this era of great spiritual uplift and exuberant faith, should not be overlooked.</note>
</p>

<p>
Amabel had been a willing learner, and her progress
was rapid. The inspiration of the higher life and the
New Faith fully possessed her. The world was a different
world. Hand in hand with Serenus she had ascended
the Mount of Transfiguration and gained a true
perspective. Things that before were solid and real had
become transparent, so that she could look through them,
and behold the spiritual verities of which they were the
cruder shadows. Her experience was not strange or abnormal,
but she felt the natural unfoldment of an additional
sense. It was orderly inner illumination. God
in <hi rend="italic">present</hi> manifestation was <hi rend="italic">everywhere</hi>, in terms of love,
purity, beauty, and goodness. Former discordant thoughts
had fled away, and the development of her own powers
amazed her.
</p>

<p>
Up to this time no word since her improvement had
passed between Serenus and herself touching their personal
affection. But she found all anxiety, the very
intensity of which had caused her illness, entirely gone.
Thrice happy Amabel! Her love had not lessened, but
it was now refined and spiritualized. She had not
be<pb n="192"/><anchor id="Pg192"/>come peculiar or preoccupied, for there was nothing
sombre in the New Faith. Her light-hearted joyousness
produced a bright ripple upon the whole surface of the
life of the palace.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon was wearing away, and Serenus must
soon take his leave. It was all too short for the lovers.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Amabel! I rejoice with thee in thy freedom and
happiness. Behold thou art like a bird released from
a cage. All things smile upon thee, and the very air
whispers its benediction.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is thou who hast guided my feet in the delightful
path that I knew not of! Oh, the joyousness of living!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have but showed thee the way to find thyself. To
interpret our own divinity is to discover our real birth-right.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Blessed be the day which opened to me the spirit
of the New Faith. Behold the religion of the Temple,
with its smoking sacrifices and priestly ordinances, now
seemeth like a hollow form. Its life is withered. I pray
thee, why were the ceremonial observances handed down
to us?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In the days of the ignorance and childhood of the
Chosen People, they could not interpret the mind of Jehovah
save through signs and symbols. Their understanding
was not open to the life of the Spirit, so they
must needs receive it veiled and softened by types. With
a childlike trust they could get glimpses of God and his
teaching through the ordained forms. The full light of
Truth would have blinded their eyes, and been counted
as foolishness. But now, learning of the head and a
puffed-up knowledge hath hidden the simple faith of the
<pb n="193"/><anchor id="Pg193"/>patriarchs and prophets, and the symbols have become
all in all, and therefore are vain and empty. A proud
scholastic philosophy hath made the hearts of the people
cold and barren.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I live now and henceforth in the New Faith,</q> said
Amabel earnestly. <q>Pray, is the Nazarene of whom thou
hast spoken its founder?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay, all truth is eternal! He was not its founder,
but its expresser and embodiment. Only as the spirit is
manifested <hi rend="italic">through the flesh</hi> doth it come to the understanding
of those whose concern is only with things that
are seen. The Son, or likeness of God, dwelleth in all
men, but he is almost unknown and unmanifest. Jesus,
knowing his internal oneness with the Father, embodied
the Christ-mind or life in its fulness, and performed the
outward works after its kind. But, O Amabel! hast thou
well considered that thou dost separate thyself from the
faith of thy father and all thy house?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, I am fully persuaded concerning the same. I
will sacrifice all things that may hinder my devotion to
the New Faith, and my efforts for its spread. I will be
a witness for its truth, and will show forth its power.</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus drew nearer, and taking her hand in his, gave
a gentle glance into the fair face at his side.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Amabel! Behold the wall which separated us hath
crumbled. We knew not how it were possible, but it hath
come to pass. Once more I tell thee that thou art dearer
to me than my life. Dost thy heart respond? and wilt
thou be mine?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O Serenus! I am persuaded of thy pure love, and am
thine own. Life with thee will be an abounding spring
<pb n="194"/><anchor id="Pg194"/>of gladness. I will share thy lot, even though persecution
surround me. Behold my spirit knoweth no more
a shadow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The ever-abiding Father’s love encloseth and sanctifieth
the human affection of our hearts. Amabel! I will
be faithful to thee even unto death!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And I to thee! In the love of God and thy love I
forsake all else!</q>
</p>

<lg>
<l>Two hearts, when truly one, no power can sever!</l>
<l>Pure souls in deep affection dwell forever:</l>
<l>The flame of love, e’en evermore will brighten,</l>
<l>And every sacrificial burden lighten!</l>

<p>
On the second evening after the stoning of Stephanos,
the members of the Inner Circle of the <foreign rend="italic">Urim</foreign> gathered in
their room near the inn of the Sheepmarket. As they
passed one by one through the long passage into the
anteroom, and thence, as approved by the doorkeeper,
through the narrow portal into their secret rendezvous,
an unwonted interest was manifest in every face and
feature. It was known that Saulus had been in consultation
with Annas, the high priest, and Caiaphas, John,
and Alexander, his kindred, and that plans for stirring
events had been made, the particulars of which were to
be made known to them. The venerable Rabbi Abdiel
was present, as the special and honored guest of Saulus.
It was an unwonted occasion when any from without were
admitted to a gathering of the Inner Circle; but the desire
of Saulus was sufficient, and besides, the Rabbi was
already known to many, not only as faithful, but as intensely
zealous for their contention.
</p>

<p>
When all were gathered, and the preliminary ritual
<pb n="196"/><anchor id="Pg196"/>had been performed, two members escorted Saulus to the
seat of the grand Dictator, and the Rabbi, as his guest of
honor, was seated upon his right. At a given signal all
arose, and with their peculiar mystic symbolism took
anew the oath of secrecy, in which the Rabbi joined.
All then were seated, and Saulus arose to give his
report.
</p>

<p>
<q>Comrades of the Inner Circle! Warders of the mysteries
of Israel! Chosen of the Chosen People! A serpent
hath crawled into our midst, and made his nest in
the Holy City. We are to crush his head. Behold this
day I have counselled with the chief priests and elders,
and have received authority to bind all blasphemers, put
them in prison, and scourge or stone them, as seemeth
expedient unto me. The Roman Procurator hath given
the Sanhedrin full power to deal with all matters pertaining
to our religion, and will in no wise hinder the
punishment that may be meted out to the followers of
the Nazarene. We therefore bind ourselves to make
havoc of all who are of the Way, and to uproot this
vile heresy, and the blasphemy of the Temple and the
Circumcision. Rise, comrades! defenders of our holy
ordinances! and swear by the sword of the Lord and of
Gideon that we will scatter our enemies and destroy
them.</q>
</p>

<p>
All arose, and forming in line, marched slowly around
the large circle, each carrying a flagon containing a remnant
of wine, the larger part having before been drank at
a given signal. Holding it aloft with the right hand,
and moving with a slow rhythm, they all joined in a
weird chant.
</p>

<pb n="197"/><anchor id="Pg197"/>

<lg>
<l>“The <foreign rend="italic">Urim</foreign> will conquer!</l>
<l>With valor well known,</l>
<l>The apostate will punish</l>
<l>With scourge, and by stone.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Saulus our captain</l>
<l>Shall lead in the fray,</l>
<l>We’ll follow his standard</l>
<l>By night and by day!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Ho! comrades, we swear</l>
<l>To crush every foe,</l>
<l>Not one will we spare,</l>
<l>To Gehenna they’ll go!”</l>
</lg>

<p>
Finally coming to a halt, and swinging their arms
above their heads, they repeated their oath with a shout,
and again took their seats.
</p>

<p>
Saulus arose to speak further; but as he was about to
open his lips, he stared into vacancy above and before
him, and was speechless. His gaze was transfixed, his
jaws parted, his cheeks blanched, and he forgot his surroundings.
</p>

<p>
<q>Away! There—it—is—again!</q> ...
</p>

<p>
Gasping for breath, he sank into his seat, overcome by
a spasm of fear. A cold perspiration covered him, and
he trembled in every limb.
</p>

<p>
<q>Our leader has fainted.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a hurrying to relieve him, and to apply restoratives.
But soon he recovered, and again stood up.
</p>

<p>
<q>It was nothing, comrades! Of late I have had disquieting
visions. Some haunting demon would drive me
from my chosen duty; but I hurl defiance at him, and at
all the demons and powers of darkness! Behold they
<pb n="198"/><anchor id="Pg198"/>but drive me to more jealous and powerful action. I
glory in persecution; for slaughter of the enemies of the
God of Israel is service to the Chosen People.</q>
</p>

<p>
As he continued, his face grew dark, his jaws and fists
were clinched, and his gestures violent. He seemed to
be fighting some unseen enemy which was present and
before him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Long live our worthy Dictator!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Woe to the enemies of the Temple!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The fate of Stephanos awaiteth them!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We will follow Saulus to the death!</q>
</p>

<p>
Such were some of the shouts that rent the air.
</p>

<p>
At length comparative quiet was restored, and plans
were formed for an attack upon the disciples of the New
Faith on the morrow. It was known that they assembled
in the Upper Chamber every morning at the third hour.
It would be easy to gather a rabble to do their bidding
if they needed aid. They were just about to separate,
when a sudden tremor passed over the frame of Rabbi
Abdiel. His features grew rigid, his muscles tense, and
he began muttering incoherent words.
</p>

<p>
<q>He hath a trance, as he is sometimes wont,</q> exclaimed
Saulus. <q>Peradventure a lying spirit possesseth
his lips, for his prophecy is always evil concerning
us.</q>
</p>

<p>
All had gathered about the Rabbi, who now began to
speak more clearly, and in a loud voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>Members of the <foreign rend="italic">Urim</foreign>! Deceivers and deceived!
Hypocrites and vipers! Ye are fighting against the God
of all the earth and his devoted servants! The cup of
your iniquity is overflowing! Your elders and
co-work<pb n="199"/><anchor id="Pg199"/>ers have slain the Chosen One,—the most righteous of
all the sons of men! His kingdom will increase forever,
while yours will soon be shattered! Your Dictator will
be his chief apostle, and ye will persecute him from city
to city!</q>
</p>

<p>
The tumult became so great that nothing more could
be heard. Some were almost ready to smite him, but it
was plainly evident that he knew not what he had been
saying. Another tremor; then his frame relaxed. He
was again himself, and astonished to see that all were
gathered about him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Down with our enemies of the New Faith!</q> he cried,
showing that when himself he was in earnest accord with
the spirit of the Inner Circle.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p>
The Rabban Gamaliel was astounded at the action of
the Sanhedrin in the case of Stephanos. As the head
of the most noted training school in Jerusalem, where
Hebrew youth were transformed into teachers and Rabbis,
his influence with the chief priests and elders was
ordinarily undoubted. But against the wave of fanaticism
and persecution which was now surging through the
Holy City, he felt himself utterly powerless. While
thoroughly loyal to the Chosen People, he, with a few
of the more liberal Pharisees, had faithfully striven to
stem the tide, calm the fierce and turbulent spirit, and
prevent any physical violence toward the members of the
New Faith. While he detested their doctrines, believed
them to be the victims of delusion, and ridiculed the
claims of the Nazarene as put forth by his disciples, he
also counselled forbearance, and believed that such
su<pb n="200"/><anchor id="Pg200"/>perstition would soon wear itself out, and come to naught
if let alone. His advice was entirely unheeded. The
worst passions of the Sanhedrin, their followers, and the
rabble were aflame, and logic and lore availed nothing.
The stoning of Stephanos had been like the scent of
fresh blood to a wolf.
</p>

<p>
The study of great psychological waves which sometimes
roll over a community, and even a nation, is most
interesting and instructive. A vast pent-up mass of human
passion, perhaps long in accumulating, like the
lava of a volcano, will occasionally find some outlet,
and all pour out in that particular direction. It is thus
that riots, mobs, revolutions, and wars originate. Like
some strange epidemic they steal in, and gather momentum
until they sweep everything before them. War
between nations, which often comes from religious prejudice,
is simply brute force and animal ferocity exercised
on a colossal scale. There is no tiger more cruel than
intolerant fanaticism, and the murder of Stephanos was
like the unchaining of such a beast. It was the starting-point
of a contagion of insanity, and Saulus was the fittest
leader in which it found embodiment. Under the
general support and sanction of the Sanhedrin, he became
for the time commander, and directed its forces.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p>
Early on the second morning after the notable tragedy,
the Rabban Gamaliel sat in his private library in a meditative
mood. The piles of inscribed parchments, and
numerous shelves loaded with rolls of manuscripts rich
with Hebrew lore, were undisturbed. The law, psalms,
and prophets, the Mishna, Gemra, Hagada, and Halacha,
<pb n="201"/><anchor id="Pg201"/>which contained the treasures of Jewish scholasticism,
and the archives of ancient polity and literature, had no
attraction. It was the problems of the present which
were pressing upon the Rabban. Never had he felt so
powerless and so unreconciled to events. Not only the
Holy City, but his own household, seemed rent in twain.
His former impetuous young student and disciple had
suddenly blossomed into the Hebrew leader of affairs in
Jerusalem, while his own influence had gone into a total
eclipse. His beautiful and idolized daughter had bestowed
the wealth of her warm youthful affection upon
an avowed apostate. Even the thought subtly intruded
itself, that it would have been more tolerable if her recent
illness had been unto death; and he pictured to
himself the possible resignation which would now possess
him if her fair form were already sleeping in the
quiet sepulchre. He bowed his head in agony as a chaos
of conflicting emotions agitated his soul, and groaned
aloud, and wept as a child might weep. All the fame,
success, and usefulness of his past life was a hollow
dream. His vaunted wisdom in the eyes of the Holy
City had turned to ashes. Worse than all, it even had
become foolishness to his own flesh and blood.
</p>

<p>
At length he aroused himself as if he had arrived at
some important and final decision. Honor, reputation,
position, and religion must be maintained, even at the
expense of family ties and affection. Shall not a man
rule his own house? Putting his emotion under foot,
and stifling the softened feeling which had possessed
him, his features became hard and unyielding, and his
lips tightly closed. He signalled a waiting-maid.
</p>

<pb n="202"/><anchor id="Pg202"/>

<p>
<q>Find Amabel, and say that I would see her.</q>
</p>

<p>
The young woman entered with a light though dignified
step, and seated herself by her father’s side. She at
once divined something unusual in his manner, and instinctively
felt that an ordeal was impending.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dear father, thou didst send for me. How can I
serve thee?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Amabel! always hast thou been a dutiful and loving
child, and it now lies in thy power to relieve me of a
load which is too heavy to be borne. When I bring the
whole matter before thee, I am persuaded that thou wilt
have respect unto my wishes.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou knowest well, O my father! that mine affection
for thee is great, and if thy request be not against my
duty and freedom, I will gladly render obedience.</q>
</p>

<p>
Just for a moment the Rabban wavered in the resolution
which he had declared should be inflexible; for he
had a distinct foreboding of a great trial, and of the
magnitude of the sacrifice that he was about to ask of
his well-beloved daughter. Be still, heart! The issue
<hi rend="italic">must</hi> be met!
</p>

<p>
<q>O my daughter! I beseech thee to be soberly mindful
of the thing whereof I shall speak unto thee. I pray
that thou wilt make a sacrifice for the sake of thy father.
My honor, reputation, office, and religion are in the balance.
Amabel! I ask thee to renounce all thought of a
future alliance with Victor Serenus, and that thou promise
to see him no more.</q>
</p>

<p>
The cheeks of Amabel visibly faded and her heart-beat
quickened, but she maintained a good degree of calmness
and self-command. She looked inquiringly into her
<pb n="203"/><anchor id="Pg203"/>father’s face, and read the stern purpose of an inflexible
will. She instinctively felt that the crisis of her life had
come. There passed a few moments of silence, though
they were not required for her to make her decision.
</p>

<p>
<q>O my father! I love thee, and it is like plucking out
the right eye to say thee nay; but nevertheless, I cannot
comply with thy request.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Amabel! mark well the issue! The Holy City is
aroused. My plea for the toleration of the new heresy
hath already cost me my honor and reputation. My wisdom
is scoffed at; and the leader of the time is no other
than my former young disciple, Saulus of Tarsus. A
wild and cruel spirit hath possessed the people, and the
Sanhedrin is in full agreement. While I bewail the zeal
of our people, which is not according to knowledge, and
believe that its madness will soon pass by, I must bow
before a storm which I cannot withstand. Even before
this commotion an alliance of the family of the Rabban
Gamaliel with the deluded Serenus would have been intolerable,
<hi rend="italic">now</hi> it would be fatal!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O my father! I am mindful of all thou sayest; but I
have promised to be the wife of Serenus, and nothing
but death can separate us. His religion is my religion,
and his God my God. There is no other young man
among the Chosen People that is worthy to be compared
with him in honor and virtue.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Even though he hath a goodly spirit in himself, he
hath cast in his lot among the despised and deluded
followers of the false prophet, and will peradventure
share their fate. Persecution, scourging, imprisonment,
and perhaps stoning, await this fanatical sect; and this
<pb n="204"/><anchor id="Pg204"/>I cannot prevent if I would. Now, hearken! Wilt thou
foolishly hold on to this base alliance with an outlaw
and heretic, disgraced, and peradventure to be put to
death, or remain in thy father’s house, with esteem and
affection, and the respect of all the most honorable and
learned people of the Holy City?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay, I will suffer dishonor, persecution, and even
death if need be, for truth, righteousness, and Victor
Serenus. Worldly honor doth not tempt me. The
prophet of Nazareth, whom our people cruelly slew, was
filled with the spirit of the true God. His followers
have the same mind, as manifested by their works; and
nothing can quench their spiritual fervor, their kindly
ministrations, and their abounding love toward all, even
their enemies.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Daughter of Gamaliel! thou art altogether mad!
Choose thou this day, yea, this hour, between thy father’s
house, with thy high station and all that therewith belongeth,
and the reproach of being an outcast, and sharing
the ignominious lot of the sect of the Nazarene. The
honor of Gamaliel shall not be entirely lost, and his word
is law! I have finished!</q>
</p>

<p>
There was no alternative.
</p>

<p>
Amabel arose from her seat, threw her arms around
her father’s neck, and kissed him warmly upon the forehead,
and then quietly turned and left him. Hastily
putting on a light outside garment and hat, she left the
palace, passed down the hill of Zion, and made her way
to the Upper Chamber. It was a little after the third
hour, and the disciples had just gathered.
</p>

<p>
There was a goodly company of men and women, as
<pb n="205"/><anchor id="Pg205"/>was wont, and words of gladness and praise abounded.
Even the fate of Stephanos, and the prospect of a general
persecution, did not seem to disquiet them. But they
were unaware of the intensity of the storm that was just
ready to burst, and that they were like sheep in the midst
of wolves. The spirit of love shone through their faces,
and many in the Holy City had been blessed by their
ministry and service, healed of divers diseases, and released
from bonds which had vexed them for years.
Serenus was there, and had just arisen to address them.
Barnabas and Peter and John were also among them.
Barnabas had been drawn to the New Faith through the
preaching of Peter, and was already one of the most
devoted among the disciples. He had ended his sojourn
at the Sheepmarket, and now made his abode with
Serenus.
</p>

<p>
Amabel quietly entered. No one present knew her except
Serenus, who marvelled at her sudden appearance.
While aware that the new light had been kindled within
her, and that she greatly rejoiced, he had entertained no
expectation that she would openly identify herself with
the despised people. Her exquisite grace and beauty,
with the fact that she was an unwonted visitor, turned
the attention of many towards her; but after a quick,
tender glance at Serenus, she cast her large lustrous eyes
downward, and closed them with a calm devotion, as she
sank into her seat among the women of the assembly.
The soul of Serenus was stirred within him as he began
speaking to the little flock.
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Brethren and sisters of the New Faith! It doth appear
unto all of you that troublous times are at hand,
<pb n="206"/><anchor id="Pg206"/>and that we are encompassed by those who falsely think
that we are their enemies. Even the power of God which
hath been bestowed upon us, and the wonderful works
and ministry which have been made manifest through us,
are turned against our people and made an offence. The
Sadducean enmity of the Sanhedrin is bitter toward us;
and the voice of Saulus, the leader of the persecution, is
hot for our destruction. Behold ye have become a <q>rock
of stumbling</q> unto both the Pharisees and Sadducees.
But I say unto you, be ye not dismayed, even though all
things seem against you. The Man of Gallilee hath
said,—</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><q>Blessed are ye when men shall reproach you and persecute
you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely
for my sake;</q> and again, <q>Blessed are they that have
been persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven.</q> Again he declared, <q>Behold the
kingdom of heaven is within you.</q> It is here. If persecution
rage without, and ye have harmony, peace, and
love within, behold it abideth in you. As the spirit of
Christ was manifested through Jesus of Nazareth, so may
it fill us to overflowing. The things which he did ye may
do also. We have the Truth, and the Truth maketh free;
yea, though prison-walls surround us, and revilings, and
even scourgings, be visited upon us, freedom abideth.
Behold liberty is of the soul, and pertaineth not to the
body. We are not in bondage to the flesh, for it profiteth
not. Not that we have aught against it in itself, for in
subjection it may render honorable service. We love all
men, and resist not evil. The triumph of violence is but
for a moment, while truth and righteousness are as
eter<pb n="207"/><anchor id="Pg207"/>nal as the reign of God. The world knoweth not the
mystery of evil, nor how resistance maketh it to increase.
Love is finally victorious, because it thinketh no evil.
God worketh not with observation, but in you, to will
and to do. Thence cometh the victory! A man’s real
foes must be they of his own household, for nothing
can truly harm him but his own base and mistaken
thoughts.</q>
</p>

<p>
The address of Serenus was followed by spontaneous
testimonies, prophecies, and spiritual affirmations, as each
was inspired to give utterance, and all opened their souls
to the Spirit of Truth. Then followed a period of stillness,
during which each one lifted his mind to Christly
ideals, and sent out loving and healing thoughts to all,
not forgetting even those who were plotting against them.
The silence continued until spiritual ecstasy prevailed,
and aspiration and soul-communion lifted them to a state
of consciousness where things of the seen and outward
life seemed distant, and rested but lightly upon them.
The calumnies and revilings concerning them which filled
the Holy City were as nothing; for they were now in
a heavenly frame made up of love, good-will, spiritual
vigor, and harmony.
</p>

<p>
At length the profound stillness was broken by a discordant
hum in the distance. The cruel persecutors
were upon their track.
</p>

<p>
The noise gradually came nearer, and soon resolved
itself into chaotic vibrations of yells, commands, shrieks,
and imprecations. Then a single stone was followed by
a volley, which crashed upon the roof, sides, and windows
of the Upper Chamber.
</p>

<pb n="208"/><anchor id="Pg208"/>

<p>
<q>Fear not the wrath of man!</q> said Serenus.
</p>

<p>
Then the little band chanted selections from the Psalms
of David:—
</p>

<lg>
<l>“I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains:</l>
<l>From whence shall my help come?</l>
<l>The Lord is thy keeper:</l>
<l>The Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.</l>
<l>The sun shall not smite thee by day,</l>
<l>Nor the moon by night.</l>
<l>The Lord shall keep thee from all evil;</l>
<l>He shall keep thy soul.</l>
<l>The Lord shall keep thy going out and thy coming in,</l>
<l>From this time forth and for evermore.</l>
<l>O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good:</l>
<l>For his mercy endureth forever.”</l>
</lg>

<p>
The mob rapidly approached. A small man with a
strong rod in his hand was slightly in advance, making
violent gestures, and giving loud commands. It was
Saulus. Clustered about him were about two score of
the members of the Inner Circle, and these were followed
by a great rabble from the worst streets and lanes of
the city.
</p>

<p>
The moments dragged slowly to the little band, for
they instinctively took in the whole situation. After
finishing the chants, the assembly was dismissed. No
one tried to escape. Even if attempted it would have
been impossible, for the house was entirely surrounded.
They gathered in little groups, and friend encouraged
friend.
</p>

<p>
Serenus was already by Amabel’s side.
</p>

<p>
<q>Beloved! How camest thou here in such a time as
this?</q>
</p>

<pb n="209"/><anchor id="Pg209"/>

<p>
<q>O Serenus! my father hath commanded me to renounce
thee and the New Faith, or leave his house.
Behold my choice!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Amabel! thou hast given up all for me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay! say rather for my soul’s freedom!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Daughter of Gamaliel, and Light of my soul! I am
powerless to protect thee from the persecutors that are at
the door. But have faith in God! All things will work
together for good. Doubt not!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have no fear! Peace, love, and courage possess my
soul.</q>
</p>

<p>
The tramp of the fierce host as it burst up the stairways
was like the noise of thunder.
</p>

<p>
With glaring eyes and panting breath Saulus bounded
into the room, closely followed by his comrades, with the
mob at their heels. Not one of the assembly raised a
hand in defence.
</p>

<p>
The utter peacefulness and non-resistance of the little
band was so strange that for a moment Saulus was astounded.
He had expected a strong fight, or at least
a desperate attempt to escape, but found neither. But
in a moment he regained command of himself, and there
was no wavering in his purpose.
</p>

<p>
<q>Heretics and blasphemers!</q> he cried. <q>We have
caught you in the very exercise of your seditious and
profane worship, and ye yourselves are witnesses to your
own criminality. I have full authority, as a loyal Hebrew,
to mete out punishment to every one of you, men
and women, and to crush this mockery of our holy
religion. Ha! a little trial by scourging, and some acquaintance
with stocks and prisons, will restore your
<pb n="210"/><anchor id="Pg210"/>minds. And if these fail, I wot that the treatment administered
to Stephanos will be found effectual.</q>
</p>

<p>
Up to this time he had not noticed that Serenus was
among them, but as he beheld his old opponent he had
special delight.
</p>

<p>
<q>Ha! Serenus! thou hast found thy true belonging.
I have thee in my power, and thy traitorous apostasy
shall reap its full reward.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then, turning to his prisoners in general, he continued,—
</p>

<p>
<q>If any of you will blaspheme Jesus, and abjure and
curse the New Faith, peradventure we may release such
with the warning of a few stripes.</q>
</p>

<p>
No one responded.
</p>

<p>
<q>Forward, comrades, and escort them to prison!</q>
</p>

<p>
Before the sixth hour of the day, every one, including
Serenus and Amabel, were surrounded by prison walls.

<p>
The persecution of the disciples of the New Faith
formed a notable epoch in the history both of Judaism
and Christianity. It was the first stage of an agitation,
which, though subsequently losing some of its local intensity,
widened and deepened until it changed the religious
complexion of nations and the world. It marked
the decadence of the existing ceremonial system, and at
the same time dispersed widely the seeds of a vital faith
which no opposition has since been able to stamp out.
</p>

<p>
History confirms the apparent paradox, that living
truth has thriven through repression; and even persecution.
Stagnation and formalism have been its greater
hindrances. It has such an inherent vitality that agitation
and antagonism may justly be regarded as important
factors in the evolutionary process which brings it
into manifestation. It develops true vigor through the
exercise of overcoming. Sometimes the Spirit seems to
slumber beneath the crust of stagnation, until active
hostility quickens its dormant energy and enables it to
break forth. Good, therefore, is often nourished from
seeming evil.
</p>

<pb n="212"/><anchor id="Pg212"/>

<p>
The intent of the chief priests and elders was to <q>slay
the young child;</q> but instead they multiplied him. The
New Faith was like a fire, and the desperate effort to
beat it out only scattered its brands among the endless
combustible material of human hearts. Even at this
early period in Jerusalem, the little flock that was apprehended
and imprisoned formed but a small fraction
of the three thousand souls which already had been possessed
by the Spirit of Truth.
</p>

<p>
Before the ninth hour of the day upon which the assembly
were thrown into prison, Gamaliel was informed
of the wholesale arrest and persecution. Believing that
the flight of Amabel would naturally be to the Upper
Chamber, it occurred to him that peradventure she
might be among the women who had been put in ward.
The situation was intolerable. The thought that his
own beautiful child, well beloved and delicately reared,
was probably imprisoned with the offscouring of the Holy
City, almost drove him beside himself. As he looked in
upon the recesses of his own soul, there was a violent
tempest, in which pride, disgrace, love, and anger were
each striving for mastery, and boiling in wild confusion.
</p>

<p>
The self-poised, reputable, and wise Educator of Jerusalem
could hardly persuade himself of his own identity.
How the events of a few hours had changed the whole
world! He, to whom thousands had come from far and
near to learn wisdom, not able to rule his own house and
teach his own offspring! Oh, how much better if Amabel
had quietly passed into the Beyond, as the physicians
had predicted during her late illness! Then the better
self made itself heard,—
</p>

<pb n="213"/><anchor id="Pg213"/>

<p>
<q>Oh, how I love her! I cannot give up my child!</q>
</p>

<p>
Bringing his thoughts to immediate events, the question
again thrust itself upon him, Is she in prison? He
was minded to seek an audience with Caiaphas, and lay
the whole matter before him privately, but upon further
thought, his pride and dignity revolted.
</p>

<p>
At length, realizing the strange fact that Saulus had
suddenly mounted to the virtual leadership and control
of the persecution, the Rabban resolved to send for him.
He felt that, notwithstanding his fiery spirit, the influence
of their former relation would make such a conference
more tolerable than any communication with the
chief priests. It was humiliating, but what better could
be done? He therefore despatched a faithful messenger
to the inn of the Sheepmarket, begging Saulus to come
to the palace, upon a pressing matter, without delay.
The intervening moments seemed all too long; but at
length the former disciple, whose will had now become
so imperious in the Holy City, was ushered into his
presence. After the usual greetings, Gamaliel introduced
the subject which lay so heavy upon his heart.
</p>

<p>
<q>O my young friend and former disciple! I am in
sore distress, and have sought audience with thee to ask
thy favor in a matter of deep concern to myself and my
office.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have much respect unto thy wishes, O worthy Rabban!
and will listen to thy request.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am minded of the great influence which hath come
to thee, O son of Benoni! both with the chief priests and
all the people, by reason of thy zeal for the established
ordinances. Before making known unto thee my special
<pb n="214"/><anchor id="Pg214"/>desire, I would inquire regarding thy purposes, and those
of the Sanhedrin, concerning the members of the new
sect which hath appeared in our midst?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We purpose to uproot and bring to naught the heresy
as quickly as possible, for the good of our religion and
nation. If peradventure there should be delay, and it
become scattered abroad, behold great harm will come to
our people and their traditions. Surely, as a teacher in
Israel, thou must be mindful of this peril.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have always felt persuaded, O Saulus, that every
false philosophy would soon come to an end. I am
mindful of the foolishness of the doctrines of the new
sect as thou art, and agree that they are harmful; but
I am persuaded that, having no root, they will soon
wither away. Dost thou not feel that persecution is unduly
bitter, and that many who have been deluded will
soon come back to the religion of their fathers if left
alone for a little time?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay, worthy Rabban, thine age and much learning
hath holden thine eyes to the urgency of the peril which
hangeth over our people. There can be no better service
to God and Israel than to kill this seditious conspiracy.
If our righteous persecution be sharp and quick, behold
it will save much trouble. It will prevent the spread of
the blasphemy, and confine the severity to a small number.
It were therefore <hi rend="italic">merciful</hi> to persecute even to the
death the betrayers of the Circumcision, before they multiply
their proselytes. Of this the Sanhedrin is fully
persuaded, and hath given me full authority to make an
end of the matter.</q>
</p>

<p>
Gamaliel recognized the hopelessness of further
argu<pb n="215"/><anchor id="Pg215"/>ment, and keenly felt how powerless he was to bring
about any moderation of the spirit and purpose of the
persecution. His opinion of the quality of the New
Faith differed little from that of Saulus; but they were
utterly unlike in their philosophy of its cure, and in their
views of toleration.
</p>

<p>
One who persecutes or murders for <q>God’s sake,</q> or
for the interest of some religion, as universal history
demonstrates, is of all cruel men the most cruel. Inquisitors
have thought that they had a heavy duty laid
upon them of <q>saving souls.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is unseemly to continue the argument,</q> said Gamaliel;
<q>and now I will make known unto thee the
special favor which I crave at thy hands. I beseech thee,
for my sake, as thy former teacher and friend, that thou
make no mention of what I am about to ask, lest it bring
dishonor upon me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I freely grant thy request,</q> replied Saulus.
</p>

<p>
The young zealot was greatly surprised at the unwonted
earnestness of the Rabban, and wondered what his petition
might be.
</p>

<p>
Brushing away a few tears that he vainly tried to suppress,
the distressed father took Saulus by the hand, and
looked urgently into his face as if to make a plea.
</p>

<p>
<q>O my young friend! behold my loved and dutiful
daughter hath been beguiled of the heresy. To-day, before
the third hour, she left me that she might join these
deluded people, thus giving up my favor, affection, home,
and honor. Peradventure she went directly to the Upper
Chamber, and hath gone to prison with the other women.
Behold my sorrow!</q>
</p>

<pb n="216"/><anchor id="Pg216"/>

<p>
<q>She hath chosen her own portion!</q> said Saulus unconcernedly.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Saulus!</q> said the Rabban pleadingly. <q>She is
young, and knoweth little of the heresy, being deceived.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will visit the prison, and find if she be among the
women. What is her name?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Amabel.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If she be with them, I will command her release, and
direct that she return to her father’s house.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I thank thee for thy great favor! After being cast
into prison, I am persuaded that when released she will
show her former wisdom in this matter.</q>
</p>

<p>
Gamaliel brightened at the renewal of his own hope,
and added,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Peradventure it is well! I perceive that nothing less
than some such experience would have turned her. Now
I soon shall see my daughter!</q>
</p>

<p>
Saulus took his leave, and proceeded directly to the
prison.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hast thou among the heretics a young woman called
Amabel?</q> asked Saulus of the keeper.
</p>

<p>
Looking over the roll, he replied in the affirmative.
</p>

<p>
<q>Release her, and command her to go to her father’s
house!</q>
</p>

<p>
Saulus disdained to make any explanation, and left at
once, without waiting to see her. Gamaliel had requested
that his name be not mentioned, and it was therefore
impossible that she should be conducted to the palace.
It would lead to recognition.
</p>

<p>
The jailer went to the cell where Amabel was incarcerated,
and unbarring the heavy door, proclaimed,—
</p>

<pb n="217"/><anchor id="Pg217"/>

<p>
<q>By order of Saulus, deputy of the Sanhedrin, behold
thou art released, and commanded to go to thy father’s
house!</q>
</p>

<p>
She passed out of the dark damp interior into the sunshine,
and disappeared in the crowded street.
</p>

<p>
Whither would she go? Her father’s house had been
closed against her. Hesitating but a moment, she turned
her back toward Mount Zion, and passing northward,
continued along the narrow street that led beyond Hezekiah’s
Pool, at length coming to the home of Serenus.
She knocked at the humble door, and was warmly received
and ministered unto by his mother, who welcomed
her as her own daughter.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p>
Saulus returned to the Sheepmarket near the close of
the eventful day, feeling that his work was well begun.
</p>

<p>
The more prominent leaders in the sedition had been
gathered in, and were to await his persuasive tactics to
force their sworn renunciation of the New Faith, and
blasphemy of its prophet. Failing in this, adequate punishment
would be meted out under his direction, and at
his convenience. He felt a peculiar pride that he had
the honor of being the chief instrument in the hands of
the God of Israel to correct, not only religious, but political
transgression. Among the circle at the inn, he was
received as a hero and public benefactor. Cassia bestowed
her congratulation, and was delighted with his
campaign of persecution.
</p>

<p>
<q>O my devoted Saulus! thou art a brave leader,
chosen of the Lord to defend our people and punish
their enemies.</q>
</p>

<pb n="218"/><anchor id="Pg218"/>

<p>
<q>Thy words are sweet unto me,</q> replied Saulus, as
they seated themselves in a secluded recess of the court,
while the twilight fell upon them. He put his arm
around her light form, and drew her close by his side.
She was very happy. During a few moments of silence,
her heart was so full of golden dreams of the future, that
she wished she might look in and behold it, as in a
mirror. The music of fancy, unheard without, filled her
soul with melody; and amid stirring scenes, her lover
was before her day and night. The embrace of his arm
tightened, and she nestled her head upon his shoulder.
Saulus was transported to a new world as he felt her
silken locks and warm breath upon his cheek, and for a
little time he forgot persecutions and prisons. Following
the swift flight of his imagination, he saw before
him, not only his complete triumph in the contest he was
waging, but a heaven upon earth, soon to begin, with the
full fruition of his love, and the possession of the idol
which for years had ruled his heart.
</p>

<p>
That wonderful intensity of nature which made Saulus
a fiery persecutor rendered him a most ardent lover.
There was nothing commonplace or mediocre within him.
The whole fabric of his character was woven of extremes,
all of which were in unceasing vibration.
</p>

<p>
Would the love of Saulus, now so exclusively centred
upon one personality with the intensity of a white heat,
ever become broadened, purified, disciplined, and diffused?
Could this stream of soul-force, now so narrow
and vehement, ever spread out, and in gentle volume
nourish barren brown fields, clothe them with living
green, and make them bud and blossom? No! says the
<pb n="219"/><anchor id="Pg219"/>world. Impossible! replies sensuous logic and intellectual
acumen. <q>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or
the leopard his spots?</q>
</p>

<p>
The persecution, now so thoroughly inaugurated, raged
with unabated ferocity. Dark and cruel weeks dragged
their weary course into months, and the cry of martyrs
was unceasing. But the heroism of the disciples of the
New Faith was a marvel. Under the inquisition of Saulus,
men and women were scourged, buffeted, put in confinement,
and stoned; and though a few recanted, nearly
all were faithful. The courage and spiritual inspiration
which had possessed Stephanos continued, and in many
cases even stoning to death produced only painless transition.
The prisoners healed each other’s distresses,
and often the persecutors themselves received from their
victims some of the outward fruits of the power of the
New Faith. But the bigoted inquisitors seemed possessed
of a collective insanity or demoniacal obsession,
outbreaking waves of which abound in history.
</p>

<p>
It would be discordant to the purpose and philosophy
which these pages aim to express through depicted
events to enlarge upon this period. A tragic story of
terrible things that abounded during this spell of unloosed
animal passion might be dramatized, which would
be well within the limits of the admitted facts of history.<note place="foot"><p>Canon Farrar, in his <q>Life and Work of St. Paul,</q> says, <q>The part
which he [Saul] played at this time in the horrid work of persecution has,
I fear, been always underrated.... So thorough was his search, and so
deadly were its effects, that, in referring to it, the Christians of Damascus
can only speak of Saul as <q>he that devastated in Jerusalem them that call
on this name,</q> using the strong word which is strictly applicable to an invading
army which scathes a conquered country with fire and sword.</q>
</p>

<p>
Conybeare and Howson, in their <q>Life and Epistles of St. Paul,</q> say,
<q>That temporary protection which had been extended to the rising sect by
such men as Gamaliel was now at an end. Pharisees and Sadducees, priests
and people, alike indulged the most violent and ungovernable fury....
The eminent and active agent in this persecution was Saul.... His fame
as an inquisitor was notorious far and wide.</q>
</p>

<p>
A few passages from the New Testament (Revised Edition) are noted:—
</p>

<p>
Acts viii. 3. But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house,
and haling men and women committed them to prison.
</p>

<p>
Acts ix. 1, 2. But Saul, yet breathing threatening and slaughter against
the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, and asked of him letters
to Damascus unto the synagogues, that if he found any that were of the
Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
Acts xxii. 4. And I persecuted this Way unto the death, binding and
delivering into prisons both men and women.
</p>

<p>
Acts xxvi. 10, 11. And this I also did in Jerusalem: and I both shut up
many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests;
and when they were put to death, I gave my vote against them. And punishing
them oftentimes in all the synagogues, I strove to make them blaspheme;
and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even
unto foreign cities.
</p>

<p>
Galatians i. 13. For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in
the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God,
and made havock of it.
</p>

<p>
1. Timothy i. 13. Though I was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor,
and injurious: howbeit I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in
unbelief.</p></note>
The theory that a realism which plunges into the
<pb n="220"/><anchor id="Pg220"/>depths of harrowing circumstance is either wholesome or
artistic will not here be followed. It is true that every
tale built upon the principles of idealism, and the portrayal
of idealistic character, cannot do without a setting
and background of contrasts which will bring truth into
high relief, but the dark shades should be kept in subordination.
</p>

<p>
At length the time came when the New Faith, like a
smothered and beaten conflagration, appeared to be
thor<pb n="221"/><anchor id="Pg221"/>oughly stamped out in Jerusalem. Every suspected
house had been visited, and every implicated man or
woman tortured or imprisoned, except such as had fled
to remote provinces, which were not a few. But Saulus
was not content with the complete conquest of the Jewish
capital. Finding that some had slipped from his grasp,
he began, like Alexander, to look about for other worlds
to conquer. Being informed that a few had fled to Damascus,
and were there promulgating the heresy, he
made ready for an expedition to that city, and received
from the Sanhedrin the necessary authority and equipment.
</p>

<p>
The terrible strain of conflicting emotion and surging
passion which had rent the soul of Saulus, fearfully told
upon him. His haggard face, nervous unrest, sleepless
nights, and hellish visions, produced an epileptic condition
which appeared in the form of occasional paroxysms,
and its scars were never afterwards fully removed. They
were ever a <q>stake in the flesh.</q>
</p>

<p>
At times, during these feverish months of delirium,
the scourgings of conscience were terrible. But the more
desperate his torment, the more he hardened himself.
Nightly visions of strange horror disquieted him. Often
during the darkness, the sighs and groans of his victims
echoed and re-echoed in his ears. He refused to be
alone at night, and under plea of illness arranged for one
of his comrades of the Inner Circle to share his apartment.
His brief periods of strange relenting were not
mentioned to his friends, and on no account would he
have had Cassia suspect them. Each short interval of
moral upheaval was followed by a more desperate
deter<pb n="222"/><anchor id="Pg222"/>mination to push the persecution. To have every nerve
tense with a hot pursuit for his prey had peculiar charm,
and yielded a thrill of delight to that part of his nature
which he thought to be himself.
</p>

<p>
Toward the last of the persecution, the flashes of goodness
and moral sanity increased in frequency. Seeming
to come up from within, they staggered his understanding.
He reproached himself for such occasional weaknesses.
Each time as they passed off he braced himself
anew, and hastened to his appointed work.
</p>

<p>
The last evening of the sojourn of Saulus in the Holy
City was drawing to a close, and his preparations for an
early departure the next morning were complete. The
day had been sultry, and the family group at the inn were
upon the house-top. The full moon, which silvered the
broad expanse of towers and battlements, seemed to wear
a sinister and ghastly aspect; and there was a redness in
its sheen which gave Saulus a slight inward shudder.
The shadows cast by surrounding objects were unwontedly
sharp and black, and he felt preternaturally sensitive
and expectant. The stirring events of his life in
the Judean capital surged in a quick torrent through his
mind, as if painted upon a swiftly revolving canvas.
Love, hate, joy, despair, and ambition, sprinkled with
the ashes of an inner and strange remorse, danced in
chaotic confusion before him. Unwelcome and forbidding
enemies seemed to be prodding him from within.
Had he not done his duty well?
</p>

<p>
Cassia interrupted his revery, and together they sought
a retired corner as they were wont. A long converse followed.
Mutual vows were exchanged and renewed, and
<pb n="223"/><anchor id="Pg223"/>plans made for the consummation of their union upon
the return of Saulus from his campaign in Damascus.
After a long-continued rehearsal of mutual visions of
present and future bliss, the moment for parting was
at hand. Saulus was about to arise from his seat; but
with eyes suddenly fixed upon vacancy, he gave a quick
gasp and sank back.
</p>

<p>
<q>What is it, Saulus? thou tremblest and art pale!
Art thou ill? <hi rend="italic">O Saulus!</hi></q>
</p>

<p>
Cassia threw her fair white arms around his neck to
reassure him. After a brief conflict with the unknown,
but with no effort to disengage himself from her soft
embrace, he replied,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay, little one! I am well! ’Twas but a passing
shudder! Some disquieting fancies seize me at unwonted
and inconvenient seasons.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O Saulus! thou art so brave and good! But thou
hast not seemed well of late! O my hero! What <hi rend="italic">can</hi>
it be?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I wot not. I am persuaded that I perform every
duty to which I am called in no uncertain manner. But
at times, peradventure I am under a spell. My heart
stands still, and my limbs shiver. I see something near
at hand which is not of earth, and the darkness seems
full of terrible shapes. But I spurn and defy them! It
is but a passing weakness, and soon will fade out. Between
my little one and the punishment of heretics my
mind will be so full that no more idle fancies can steal
in. See! I am well now! I am strong! Peace be with
thee! ’Twill be but for a short season, little one, when
behold, thou art mine, and I am thine forever!</q>
</p>

<pb n="224"/><anchor id="Pg224"/>

<p>
A final embrace, and a whispering of eternal love, and
they parted.
</p>

<p>
Saulus reached his chamber in a very uncertain mood.
Despite the brave words just uttered, and with his comrade
soundly sleeping near by, the very silence seemed
oppressive and retributive. The atmosphere was charged
with malignity, and every breath feverish and bitter. He
tried desperately to fasten his thoughts upon Cassia,
so as to shut out dire fancies. Thus for a few moments
he would perch upon empyrean heights, only to
be quickly cast down into horrible chasms.
</p>

<lg>
<l>“A mind not to be chang’d by place or time.</l>
<l>The mind is its own place, and in itself</l>
<l>Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.”</l>
</lg>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
A thick mist of delirium seemed to gather in the darkness,
and nameless Horrors danced around and leered at
him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, for sleep! Come, oh, come, oblivion, and blot
me out! Why was I ever born? Have I a demon within
me? Am I myself or It? No! Away! I dare and defy
thee! O God of Israel! I serve thee, and nothing shall
shake me!</q>
</p>

<p>
Finally, from sheer exhaustion, and in a cold sweat,
he fell into a troubled sleep. But phantoms in kaleidoscopic
array peopled his dreams. At length three loud
raps at the door aroused him, and froze the blood in his
veins. There It stood!
</p>

<p>
<q>O heaven! mercy! There! there! It points its
<pb n="225"/><anchor id="Pg225"/>bony finger at me! Guilty? <hi rend="italic">No! no!</hi> I am righteous—<hi rend="italic">righteous!</hi></q>
</p>

<p>
He leaped from his couch, and ran to his comrade and
shook him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Look! look! dost thou not see It?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I see nothing! Saulus, quiet thyself! behold all is
well!</q>
</p>

<p>
Saulus crept back to his couch, more uncertain who
and what he was than ever.
</p>

<p>
A hellish torment was within and without!
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
As the first faint flush of dawn entered through the
casement of his chamber, turning the blackness into
gray, Saulus awoke from a half-conscious despair, and,
wonder of wonders, a feeling of heavenly harmony possessed
his soul! Peace, like a broad, glassy river, was
borne in upon him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Am I Saulus?</q>
</p>

<lg>
<l>“Calm on the listening ear of night</l>
<l>Come Heaven’s melodious strains.”</l>
</lg>

<p>
Iridescent tints of beauty filled the room. His soul
floated through, and was bathed in a symphony of harmonious
sound-waves, sweeter than a thousand harps of
Æolia. The atmosphere seemed charged with an impersonal
and universal love, and its message was written in
letters of light upon the walls of his chamber. The fragrance
of roses was wafted in upon his bewildered senses.
A heavenly chorus of benedictions, distant, but enchanting
in quality, reached him, as though echoed and
<pb n="226"/><anchor id="Pg226"/>re-echoed through long corridors. He felt his soul expanding
and responding, as he seemed to inhale a spirit
of inspiration. An angelic visitor in white robes stood
before him, and whispered, <q>I am Prophecy,</q> and with
a winning smile pointed upward. What a vision! What
brightness! What beauty!
</p>

<p>
<q>Have I died, and is this paradise? But see! It begins
to fade! Stay, Oh, <hi rend="italic">stay</hi>! Leave me not! <hi rend="italic">No! no!
no!</hi></q>
</p>

<p>
It had gone, but the room was still—so still! The
silence might almost be felt. What a strange calmness!
The soul of Saulus was as placid as the mirror-like
surface of a pool untouched by a zephyr. He heard a
voice, distinct, but so low and sweet that he could not
tell whether it were audible or in his soul.
</p>

<p>
<q>Saulus! I am the divine image within thee,—thy
real self! I am spirit, and possess the deeps of thy Being.
I am the quickened but unmanifest Saulus. In thy
consciousness thou dost mistake a false and perverted
self for me. I am yet entombed! Bid me come forth!</q>
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
The morning dawned brightly, and found Saulus as he
was wont. Oh, how vivid the visions! It seemed as if
he had wandered for a whole night in the infernal regions,
and anon been transported for a brief morning hour to
heaven. How utterly indescribable!
</p>

<p>
<q>What meaneth this? Oh, that I might grasp that
heavenly condition! But it is gone, utterly gone!</q>
</p>

<p>
Time lingers not, and the appointed hour for departure
was close at hand. He hastily arose, and made his
<pb n="227"/><anchor id="Pg227"/>final preparations for the long journey. His comrades,
who were to accompany him, were already waiting, and
impatient for the start. Waving Cassia a final adieu, as
she looked down from her casement, Saulus and his retinue
wound rapidly northward through the narrow streets,
and passed out through the Damascus Gate. Before the
sun had climbed far above the horizon they had left the
Holy City well behind.

<p>
It is expedient that we return, and gather up a few
threads that were dropped at the close of the chapter
preceding the last. On the eventful morning when the
comrades gathered at the Sheepmarket, and departed for
the Upper Chamber to apprehend the assembly, there
was a small party left behind which demands further
notice. A controversy took place, and the little circle
was rent by the decided and outspoken condemnation of
Rebecca of the proposed movement.
</p>

<p>
<q>Saulus seems beside himself in this mad persecution!</q>
she exclaimed with a deep flush. <q>I think the
new sect has a right to live peaceably, and be free from
molestation. God speed their escape!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Daughter! thou speakest wildly!</q> said Benoni reprovingly.
<q>I bid thee hold thy peace! It would have
been well for us had we left thee in Tarsus.</q>
</p>

<pb n="229"/><anchor id="Pg229"/>

<p>
Rebecca said no more, but held her own thoughts
firmly. Since the stampede from the Temple, when her
life was saved by the young stranger, she had made many
apologies for, if not an actual defence of, the disciples of
the New Faith. Her unknown rescuer had not told her
that he was one of them, but she had an indefinable feeling
that he might be of their number. His words and
spirit were unlike those of any one she knew who was
subject to the ceremonial system. How opposite in temper
from her own brother, whom she began to fear was
possessed by an evil spirit! It was not so much what
Serenus had said, when he conveyed her to her home in
her faint and exhausted condition, for their conversation
had been brief and general; but his dignified mien, lofty
spirit, and utter unselfishness greatly impressed her. His
very presence had seemed an inspiration. How strange,
that in answer to her question he should have announced
himself merely as the <q>friend of Saulus</q>! Knowing
nothing of his name or dwelling-place, she often wondered
whether she might ever see him again. While
naturally retiring, and rarely looking into the faces of
strangers, it must be confessed that, as opportunity offered,
she had some dim expectation that she would
again behold the face of her kind benefactor.
</p>

<p>
Who is able to unravel the mysteries of a maiden’s
heart? Who can untwist the delicate strands which,
when combined, are able to guide and draw a gentle
soul, and give it the force and direction of a new
orbit?
</p>

<p>
In the case of Rebecca, the vital service rendered
would, of itself, make gratitude strong and lasting. The
<pb n="230"/><anchor id="Pg230"/>lofty principles expressed, though in a brief and unstudied
way, would also strike a unison in such a pure
and intuitional nature as that of Rebecca. For a long
time she had been quietly growing away from the heartless
formalism of her people. She was ready for something
better. Without knowing anything of the letter of
the New Faith, peradventure its invisible vibrations
were beating gently upon the strings of her higher nature,
even though unrecognized.
</p>

<p>
Was there a mingled element of unconscious love subtly
growing out of so brief an episode? What more natural?
and yet what prophet can say either yea or nay?
</p>

<p>
As Saulus and his concourse moved away toward the
Upper Chamber, an intense interest and curiosity possessed
those who were left behind as to the outcome of
the day’s proceedings. All felt that an important crisis
had arrived. Cassia was exultant, while Rebecca was
cast down. But despite their unlikeness, they preserved
friendly relations for the sake of Saulus. Prospective
sisterhood rendered each forbearing. Rebecca was sorely
tried, but must needs not rebel against her surroundings.
</p>

<p>
Almon, the keeper of the hostelry, who had followed
the concourse in the distance, soon returned, and announced
to the family that the blasphemers were securely
under arrest.
</p>

<p>
<q>I bear you good tidings,</q> said he, as with manifest
glee he entered the court of the inn. <q>Saulus and his
friends have the whole band under arrest, and they are
soon to be taken in a procession to prison.</q>
</p>

<p>
Cassia clapped her little white hands with delight.
<pb n="231"/><anchor id="Pg231"/>Rabbi Abdiel and Benoni were exultant in their approval,
while Rebecca was silent.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold,</q> continued Almon, <q>the direct way from the
Upper Chamber to the prison leads by the inn, so that
captors and captives will soon move past our very doors.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To the house-top!</q> exclaimed Cassia excitedly. <q>Let
us all go up and see the procession when it passes.</q>
</p>

<p>
She bounded up two stairways in hot haste, and the
others soon followed. Rebecca would fain have been
spared the sight, but something seemed to draw her.
</p>

<p>
There is frequently an indescribable fascination in
beholding just that which one does not wish to behold.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is a proud day for thy son, O Benoni!</q> quoth the
Rabbi.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, my brother; Saulus directs all this matter as
seemeth him good.</q>
</p>

<p>
They had not long to wait.
</p>

<p>
From the distance, fierce cries, cheers, and curses
echoed above the general hum of voices; and soon a
black mass of moving figures surged slowly along one
of the narrow streets that led into the square. Near the
front was the untiring figure of Saulus, directing the
movement of the throng. His eyes flashed, his step was
firm, and his air that of a military conqueror returning
from a victorious campaign.
</p>

<p>
When the motley crowd came near, the little group
ranged themselves along the parapet that they might
observe every feature of the procession. From their vantage-ground,
it was easy to study every face, as it passed
directly in front.
</p>

<p>
The venerable Abdiel waved his hands with
satisfac<pb n="232"/><anchor id="Pg232"/>tion, and blessed the God of Israel; and Saulus, looking
up, proudly returned the salutation.
</p>

<p>
Near the head of the line of prisoners was a tall, dignified
young man of noble presence and calm features,
whose bearing and costume marked him as one of the
most notable among them. Rebecca saw him, and instinctively
exclaimed,—
</p>

<p>
<q>It is he!</q>
</p>

<p>
At the same moment, the young man turned his eyes
upward, and their glances met. A slight nod of recognition
passed between them, which was noticed by the
others, so that Rebecca was forced to explain.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold it is he who saved me on the day of the
great stampede at the Temple! I know not his name,
but he called himself <q>the friend of Saulus.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
Almon also gave an exclamation of great surprise.
</p>

<p>
<q>As I live, that is the man!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Who is this man, O Almon?</q> said Benoni, astounded
at the double recognition of the prisoner.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is he who saved Saulus from the thieves, and
brought him to the inn at midnight, and ministered unto
him. I wot not his name, but—oh, wonder of wonders!—as
to Rebecca, he also proclaimed himself to me as
the <q>friend of Saulus.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Surely, there must be some mistake!</q> said Benoni.
<q><hi rend="italic">Such</hi> a man among the prisoners!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Shame on the persecution!</q> exclaimed Rebecca.
<q>Is Saulus to imprison the young hero who saved not
only my life, but his own also?</q>
</p>

<p>
On the evening of the same day, Saulus despatched
the following letter:—
</p>

<pb n="233"/><anchor id="Pg233"/>

<p><text><body>
<salute rend="text-align: left">“<hi rend="smallcaps">Officer in charge of the prisoners.</hi></salute>

<p>
<hi rend="italic">Sir</hi>,—Circumstances have conspired to cause me to change
the special order which I gave thee concerning the heretic,
Victor Serenus. I was then minded to reserve him for unwonted
punishment, and that speedily; but behold I now order
that thou at once release him, upon the condition that he leave
the Holy City before the rising of to-morrow’s sun, never to
return.
</p>

<signed rend="text-align: right"><hi rend="smallcaps">Saulus</hi>,<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Deputy of the Sanhedrin</hi>.”</signed>

</body></text></p>

<p>
Before the hours of evening were far advanced, the
hearts of Amabel and the mother of Serenus were made
glad by his arrival. Their surprise could hardly have
been greater had he dropped from the skies.
</p>

<p>
<q>O children of the New Faith!</q> exclaimed the mother;
<q>God is good! All is good! Even out of seeming evil
springeth good! The law of the Lord is perfect!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What a day of fulfilment!</q> said Serenus. <q>Prison
doors are opened through the power of the Truth. Bonds
are stricken off, not by an interposition which suspends
divine law, but through its perfect and orderly working.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea,</q> said Amabel; <q>the loving thought which thou
hast held towards Saulus, even though unknown by him,
hath borne its fruit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The condition of my freedom,</q> said Serenus, <q>is
that I leave the Holy City before the rising of to-morrow’s
sun, never to return; but this in no wise disquiets
me.</q>
</p>

<p>
Amabel’s cheeks grew pale, but she was silent.
</p>

<p>
<q>In time past,</q> continued Serenus, <q>it often seemed
expedient that I depart from here, that peradventure
I might kindle the flame of the New Faith in strange
<pb n="234"/><anchor id="Pg234"/>cities. But that concerning which I was formerly in
doubt hath now been made clear to me. While in the
prison cell, the Inner Guide prompted me that I should
depart, but I wot not how it would come to pass. I must
go, even to Rome, that from the heart of the world I
may witness for the truth.</q>
</p>

<p>
He cast an inquiring look at Amabel.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Amabel! With thy devotion to the higher life,
thou hast also given me a place in thine heart. Art
thou willing to sacrifice worldly preferment, and share
my lot, that we may go hand in hand to plant the standard
of a pure spiritual religion? Canst thou with me
bear hardship and seeming dishonor, yea, and peradventure
further persecution, for the love of God, the
sake of truth, and the good of thy kind?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, Serenus! I fear nothing! I am willing, nay,
glad, to go with thee to the ends of the earth, that I may
help thee to succor the distressed, strengthen the weak,
raise the fallen, and awake those who sleep, whether in
the flesh, or in dead works and ceremonies. The Voice
within me says—<hi rend="italic">go</hi>!</q>
</p>

<p>
The mother of Serenus placed her hands upon the
heads of her children, and gave them a loving dedication
and benediction.
</p>

<p>
Everything was speedily arranged for an early departure
on the morrow. An ordained disciple of the New
Faith, who lived hard by, would come in at early dawn
and unite Serenus and Amabel in marriage, according to
the simple rites of the Upper Chamber. Before the midnight
hour every preparation was completed for the new
life so soon to begin.
</p>

<pb n="235"/><anchor id="Pg235"/>

<p>
During the silent hours, Peace, like a river, flowed in
upon the souls in the quiet home.
</p>

<p>
Before the early dawn had fairly chased away the deep
shadows of night, Serenus and Amabel were wedded.
</p>

<lg>
<l>“They spoke of love, such love as spirits feel</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In worlds whose course is equable and pure;</l>
<l>No fears to beat away, no strife to heal,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The past unsighed for, and the future sure.”</l>
</lg>

<p>
As the morning mists were being dissipated, and the
Temple roof gilded by the first rays of the rising sun,
Serenus and Amabel, well mounted on small but hardy
steeds, passed out through the gate leading toward the
seaport of Cæsarea. The mother was to follow in a few
days in the company of a convenient caravan.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb"/>

<p>
Passing forward at a single bound, over the months of
hot persecution noted in the preceding chapter, during
which Serenus and Amabel were far away, we rejoin
Saulus and his band on the way to Damascus. The first
stage of the journey was over the Roman road which led
from Jerusalem to Cæsarea.
</p>

<p>
As the Judean sun climbed higher in the heavens, and
poured out his fiery rays, they rode rapidly along the
hill-country which forms the divide between the valley
of the Jordan and the Mediterranean. At intervals from
some elevated spot over which the route led, they would
halt for a few moments, and cast a lingering look backward
upon the now distant golden Temple roof, and the
white towers and battlements which they had left far
behind. Anon a far-searching glance to the westward
<pb n="236"/><anchor id="Pg236"/>would faintly disclose the deep blue of the Great Sea.
Every foot of the way was rich in historic association to
the Israelite, and every town and village consecrated by
some event which formed a part of the national folk-lore.
</p>

<p>
The companions of Saulus proposed a rest of a few
hours during the intense heat of the midday; but he
refused to make more than a brief stop, barely permitting
space to feed the animals and satisfy their own
hunger. He was even impatient at the ordinary rate of
progress, and was minded to hurry forward. The next
morning they saw Mount Gerizim, <q>the Mount of Blessing,</q>
towering up in the distance before them. Upon
that bald, brown summit Moses had stationed the priests
and Levites, to bless the Children of Israel when they
passed over Jordan.
</p>

<p>
The route wound through the soft green fields which
lie around the base of the mountain, and midday brought
them to Shechem in Samaria, where they stopped for
refreshment. On this hallowed ground Jacob had encamped
and erected an altar, and here Joseph had been
sent to seek his brethren. On this spot Joshua had
gathered all the elders and judges of Israel, and they
<q>presented themselves before God.</q>
</p>

<p>
Saulus was familiar with all this rich heritage of national
history, so full of meaning to the Chosen People;
but now it palled upon him, and seemed dim and distant.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the Roman road at this point, they took the
Damascus route to the northeast, which was much more
rough and difficult. Passing Mount Ebal and Mount
Tabor, and skirting the beautiful Sea of Galilee, set
<pb n="237"/><anchor id="Pg237"/>like a gem amid the surrounding hills, they pressed on,
until on the morning of the sixth day they found themselves
not far from their journey’s end.
</p>

<p>
To the west, and parallel with the last stage of their
journey, the lofty chain of the Antilibanus stretched itself,
like a huge wall, northward and southward as far as
the eye could reach. Crowning all, with serene dignity
and cool and dazzling whiteness, snow-capped Hermon
formed a strange contrast with the torrid Syrian wilderness
which immediately surrounded them.
</p>

<p>
Two hours more, and now, in the far distance, there
was dimly visible the <q>Eye of the East,</q>—beautiful
Damascus. On they pressed, and it gradually enlarged.
Now its white terraced roofs and cupolas began to resolve
themselves, and assume shape and character. In
what a mass of living green was the city embowered!
Behold a great wide-stretching emerald oasis was in
front, in striking contrast with the bare brown desert,
within the confines of which they still lingered.
</p>

<p>
Soon they passed for a short distance over one of the
spurs of the Antilibanus, and could look down and follow
with the eye the courses of the long winding Pharpar
and the <q>golden Abana,</q> as they transform the wilderness,
and cause it to bud and blossom like the rose.
What wonderful beauty!
</p>

<p>
By Eastern metaphor Damascus was <q>a handful of
pearls in its goblet of emerald.</q> The perennial streams
from Lebanon spread into rivulets, and gurgle and disport
themselves, forming the bases for blooming gardens
of flowers and fruits—a terrestrial paradise.
</p>

<p>
Again they descended to the brown, scorched plain,
<pb n="238"/><anchor id="Pg238"/>and the torrid noonday was at hand. But before the
flight of another hour they would be in Damascus, encircled
and refreshed by its clear cool streams—their
journey ended.
</p>

<p>
The time since they had left Jerusalem seemed well-nigh
age-long to the young zealot. Deprived of the hot
hunt, which for months had hardly afforded space for
a quiet thought, he was forced to think. In vain he essayed
to still the confused hum of the mechanism of his
soul. To a mind under less intense pressure, and free
from a stored-up mass of vivid tragic pictures, the changing
scenery and stirring events of the journey would
have afforded occupation. But to Saulus every hour was
an hour of agony, its slowness interminable.
</p>

<p>
The outward world of variety and beauty meant nothing
to Saulus now, for he was dwelling in a thought-world
of his own contriving. He had walled himself
around with abnormal and inhuman elements, and look
which way he might, they must stare at him, face to
face.
</p>

<p>
Nearer, vastly nearer than his surrounding comrades,
were the living, barbed thoughts, which like imps of
darkness peopled his mind.
</p>

<p>
On the walls and corridors of his soul were hung,
high and low, moving, burning panoramas, and gaze upon
them he must. The hellish art, which he had unwittingly
moulded and upreared, thickly curtained the picturesque
hills and valleys, the grand mountains, blue
seas, and flowing rivers, which were incidental to the
journey. The prods of an ox-goad to his outer flesh
would have seemed tolerable could they have been
re<pb n="239"/><anchor id="Pg239"/>ceived in exchange for those unseen goadings which
punctured his guilty consciousness.
</p>

<p>
What subtle and often warring forces make up the
mind of man! How it may kindle, unwittingly and
even conscientiously, at its own centre, hellish flames;
while the same energies, used after the divine order, will
create heavenly harmonies and immortal loves!
</p>

<p>
How prolific are thought-activities, and how blind the
world to the related sequences which are bound to them
by hooks of steel! How untiringly the false self, in the
ignorance of its own deeper nature, forges bonds for its
own inthralment!
</p>

<p>
But though unheeded, the Inner Guide is ever awaiting
an opportunity to blaze the path to freedom.
</p>

<p>
It matters not that the intangible scorpions which
sting the human consciousness have been invoked in the
name and guise of religion. Their retributive venom is
not thereby lessened.
</p>

<p>
Each soul rears its own dwelling-place, and puts in
furnishings which correspond. The objective divine order
is good, and only good. Those spectres and distortions
which are called wrong, evil, and even hell, which
shrivel and blast human lives, are the creations of disorderly
and unregulated thought-forces. The beautiful
stuff from which both an inner and outer paradise may
be builded is strewn around in endless profusion. It
is mis-direction which makes it <q>evil.</q>
</p>

<p>
Before demonstrating beauty and perfection, men make
educational mistakes, but the mockery and hollowness of
failure finally drive them to the Real.
</p>

<p>
Hell is corrective rather than vindictive, a condition
<pb n="240"/><anchor id="Pg240"/>of mind, and not a place. It is as possible in this realm
as the next, and Saulus was there. He was a realist,
and had lived entirely from the outside. No lighter
measure of flames would have sufficed to bring him to
himself, and lead him to discover true being.
</p>

<p>
Punishment is kindly in its mission to the world.
Man would fain sever cause and effect, but God has
bound them together. Had not a flame in the soul of
Saulus broken in upon his persecutions, they would not
have been arrested.
</p>

<p>
Purifying fires reduce the Counterfeit to ashes, and
then man is revealed to himself in his inmost and divine
image. If evil were an objective Reality, when
would be its end? Thanks to the Universal Order, it is
but a subjective disciplinary experience, and carries
within the seeds of its own limitation and final dissolution.
</p>

<p>
Mingled with the agony which made up the weary
days and nights of the journey, Saulus had brief ecstatic
upliftments and visions. Often they would pass into
short trances, when he would lose all sense of time and
surrounding, and dwell in the realm of the unseen. His
violent transitions, often accompanied by some physical
epileptic symptoms, were a source of great wonder to his
companions, who were exceedingly superstitious concerning
such weird phenomena. Was he possessed at times
of good and evil spirits, or was he on the verge of
lunacy?
</p>

<p>
The strange and ungovernable moods of Saulus, with
their sharp contradictions, greatly undermined his leadership,
and the ardor of his attendants was visibly
damp<pb n="241"/><anchor id="Pg241"/>ened. A few secretly cursed the day upon which they
joined the crusade. That aforetime unfaltering hero,
who with iron will had inspired them in former days,
was broken, and almost feeble. Courage alternated with
violent and foolish fears. He heard pursuers upon his
track, and saw faces and Shapes that were unshared in
the experience of his comrades. Fierce outbursts of the
spirit of persecution were followed by fits of moaning
and weeping. When he came out of his trances, he was
at a loss to know whether he had been out of the body or
in the body.
</p>

<p>
It seemed as though Titanic forces within the soul of
Saulus were battling for its possession, with varying victory
and defeat. What direction will this tremendous
soul-force finally take? An Inner Spirit was expanding
which threatened to burst the bonds and standards of the
outer world. Education, religion, custom, and ceremonial
obligation quivered in the balance.
</p>

<p>
The beautiful city of the East was now in the immediate
foreground. But with all its loveliness, it stood
forth as the embodiment of <hi rend="italic">continued persecution and death</hi>.
That shaft pierced between the joints of the soul’s armor
and went home. Saulus was struck through and through
by a shock of spiritual electricity. The overstrained
tension of the bond which held him to the Old snapped
under the stress of the terrible vision.<note place="foot">As to the historic literalism of the external phenomena said to be connected
with this notable inner transition, the author has no desire to dogmatize
either pro or con. It is the privilege and right of every one to make
his own interpretation. But however exact in outward detail the somewhat
variable records may be supposed to be, we think that all will agree that the
external setting does not transcend the realm of incidental unimportance.</note>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sweet flowers are springing no mortal can see,</l>
<l>So deep in my soul the still prayer of devotion,</l>

<p>
<q>What a vision of beauty!</q>
</p>

<p>
Such was the exclamation of Amabel, as for the first
time she looked upon the deep blue Mediterranean.
</p>

<p>
The sun was just about to hide himself below the rim
of the boundless mirror-like expanse of water, as the
newly wedded pair seated themselves upon one of the
house-tops of Cæsarea.
</p>

<p>
Their journey from Jerusalem had been taken by easy
stages, and two hours before they had arrived at the new
seaport which had been built by Herod the Great, and
named for his imperial master at Rome.
</p>

<p>
Here, where threescore years before there had been
but an insignificant fishing-town with no harbor, now
stood the imposing capital of Judea, with a commerce of
no mean proportions. Besides the spacious and pretentious
Herodian palace, there was a temple dedicated to
the <q>divine Cæsar,</q> a theatre, amphitheatre, and other
public buildings, which gave it the aspect of a metropolis.
The harbor had been artificially constructed at
<pb n="246"/><anchor id="Pg246"/>enormous expense by Roman skill and enterprise under
Herod’s direction. He caused immense blocks of stone
to be brought from a long distance, and sunk to the
depth of twenty fathoms, forming a semi-circular mole,
protected from the south and west, with a narrow entrance
on the north, within which ships could find secure
anchorage and refuge.
</p>

<p>
The strong hand of Rome reached out in every direction
during the days of her imperial greatness, and her
works, marvellous in their extent and solidity, reached
almost to the <q>ends of the earth.</q> Far outlasting the
conquests of her panoplied legions and the sweep of
her civil authority, her massive bridges, roads, harbors,
palaces, and towers formed enduring monuments of a material
greatness, unique in human history. What might
she not have accomplished had not corruption, sensuality,
and cruelty, like gnawing worms, eaten out her very
heart and life, leaving her a gilded sepulchre?
</p>

<p>
Absorbed by the picturesque charm and unwonted variety
of the scenery about them, Serenus and Amabel
sat for some time silent, while feasting their souls upon
its richness. Behind them, to the north and east, were
the green, wide-stretching slopes of Mount Carmel, with
vineyards and olive-groves, softened by a purple haze
which seemed like a mystical benediction—the parting
gift of day.
</p>

<p>
The endless expanse of the great sea before them was
so calm in its unruffled peacefulness that it seemed to
be sleeping upon the bosom of the Infinite. The warm
and dreamy atmosphere was laden with the perfume of
gardens, which skirted the shore and climbed the
hill-<pb n="247"/><anchor id="Pg247"/>sides, while their dark green foliage, with blossoms of
many hues, was reflected with a gentle quiver in the
neighboring deeps. The inspiration of the scene justified
the feeling that God dwells with and in men, and
that his Spirit and Life shine through all material things,
even though unrecognized, save by those whose eyes have
been opened to the higher and deeper vision of the Real.
</p>

<p>
A few fishermen were lazily rowing their light craft
homeward, while others, who had already landed, were
hanging their nets upon the cliffs to dry. In the distance
the shrill tones of the shepherd’s pipe calling his
flock, the varying vibrations of bird-notes, and the hum
of insects, rounded out the delicious harmony of sound
and sight. At length the sun disappeared, and the radiant
afterglow seemed to transform the sea into a great
pearl, whose ever-changing opalescence gradually deepened
as evening drew on.
</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 4">“How beautiful is night!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A dewy freshness fills the silent air;</l>
<l>No mist obscures; nor cloud, nor speck, nor stain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Breaks the serene of heaven:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 4">How beautiful is night!”</l>
</lg>

<p>
Serenus aroused himself from deep contemplation.
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Behold, O Amabel! what we see is but an unrolled
parchment inscribed with living characters for our translation.
The voice of God through his works is even
<pb n="248"/><anchor id="Pg248"/>more direct than that which cometh through the mouths
of patriarchs and prophets. Saith the sweet singer of
Israel,—</q>
</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 8">‘Day unto day uttereth speech,</l>
<l>And night unto night sheweth knowledge.’”</l>
</lg>

<p>
<q>But, O Serenus! who is wise enough to give it interpretation?
What sayest thou of the Greeks, who worship
Nature, and vainly imagine that they hear her many
voices? Are they not corrupt and deluded?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The Grecian pantheism is not a communion with
and aspiration after God, who is beneficent and universal,
but rather an homage paid to blind, discordant, and
warring forces, which are but the reflection of the lower
and sensuous thoughts of the worshipper. The love of
the beautiful in the Greek is a wholesome element in
itself, but it is concerned mainly with appearances,
rather than with the divine love which is articulated
through them. Outward forms are but shadows, and he
who doth not look through and beyond them is unable
to translate their low, sweet language.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Canst thou teach thy willing disciple why the same
Nature exalteth some, while others find no pleasure even
in scenes like this?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Dear Amabel! it may be likened unto a great mirror,
in which one seeth the qualities of his own thought
and soul reflected. To the cruel, Nature is pitiless, and
even malignant; to the sorrowing, she is sad; and to the
joyful, a delight. Even though the base may see some
comeliness in her graceful forms, yet in spirit and character
she is to every one whatsoever he maketh her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How can that be?</q>
</p>

<pb n="249"/><anchor id="Pg249"/>

<p>
<q>Behold, every man giveth color to things without, by
the manner of his thought concerning them. To the
good, all things are good, and to the pure, all things
are pure. We gradually transform them by a transformation
in ourselves, and such an inward growth may be
compassed in an orderly manner with assurance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But worldly wisdom hath not discerned this hidden
path.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Verily it hath not! But it will be our delight to
help in spreading this truth, and to enlighten darkened
minds, as effectual doors are opened unto us. As you
have learned also, the bodily tabernacle may be lifted
from vexatious conditions so that it may render reasonable
and pleasing service through the renewing of the
mind.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Light of my life! truly the understanding of these
things is above the price of rubies!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou speakest wisely, dear Amabel! Its very nearness
causeth it to be veiled from the logic and learning
of the schools. They look only with the eyes of outward
observation and are moved by <q>lo here,</q> and <q>lo
there,</q> having no light within. The creative power of
high thoughts and divine ideals hath not been discovered
by them. God in Nature is the Universal Life, and in
man, the Son and Brother,—the Christ!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How beautiful! Did the prophet of Nazareth teach
these things?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, verily; to him Nature was transparent. The
lilies of the field and the fowls of the air furnished him
with lessons to men, and the childlike spirit of little
ones was interpreted and likened to the kingdom of
<pb n="250"/><anchor id="Pg250"/>heaven. His judgment had to do with the thoughts
and intents of the heart rather than with outward appearances
and observances. He saw God’s image in
himself. Other men have it in the inmost, but ignorantly
cover it with vain and delusive imaginings. They
will continue to be self-deceived so long as they behold
their bodies as themselves. They who dwell in appearances
cannot discern the Spirit. Some of the ancient
prophets and poets saw God everywhere; but of this generation,
both Jew and Gentile only feel him in special
temples and synagogues, and at set times and seasons.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, O Serenus! if all forces and lives are a part of
the one and universal life of God, whence cometh tempests
and lightnings and floods?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The lack of a spiritual self-consciousness, and the
mistaken feeling that our seen forms are our real selves,
make such things seem evil. They are but the labor
and travail of Nature, and with our spiritual growth their
terrors will disappear. At length we shall learn their
laws, and make them our willing servants. This would
be so now, were we not, ignorantly, slaves of the seen!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hast thou attained unto all that thou makest known
unto me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No one can fully separate himself from his day and
generation, even though the spiritual pattern be truly
discerned. We have not overcome, but are overcoming.
The Ideal is the inmost Real, but no one save Jesus of
Nazareth hath made it fully manifest. We press forward
toward the Christly mind as shown through him,
and can count as already ours that measure of spiritual
stature which filleth our desire.</q>

<p>
<q>Whence hast thou this wisdom, which my father,
the famous teacher and Rabban, never found?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It cometh not through scholastic excellence and the
logic of the head, but by simple openness to the Spirit
of Truth. The power of God-likeness groweth through
the earnest desire of at-one-ment, rather than by a reasoning
philosophy concerning it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold, as thy disciple, I now perceive how one
may be in the seen and yet of the unseen!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They are one; yet the outer is only an aspect of the
living realities which repose behind it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O my dear husband and teacher!</q> exclaimed Amabel
with delight; <q>Nature will be more beautiful than
ever before, because I feel its spirit, and behold it as a
visible revelation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, bride of my heart! Love is everywhere written
in living characters! Our deeper vision must be open
to read them!</q>
</p>

<p>
The shadows of evening were thickening, and the
happy pair reluctantly bade adieu to their delectable
vision upon the house-top, and descended again to mingle
with their kind, and minister to human necessity.
</p>

<p>
Serenus had expected to find some vessel at Cæsarea
bound directly for Italy, which would land at Puteoli or
Brundusium, from either of which ports the journey to
Rome would be made by land. But upon ascertaining
that there was no immediate prospect for such an
opportunity, and that the Salapiæ, a merchantman of
good repute, was already laden for Tarsus, and to sail
on the following day, he decided to embark for the
Cilician capital. They would remain there for a time,
<pb n="252"/><anchor id="Pg252"/>until they were minded to take the rest of the proposed
journey.
</p>

<p>
Tarsus, being a great metropolis, the seat of important
schools of learning, and the meeting-place of many
peoples and races, might prove a fertile field for sowing
the seed of the New Faith. Amabel entered heartily
into the plan. Though the birthplace of Saulus, it was
beyond the reach of the Judean persecutions.
</p>

<p>
The Salapiæ was a Phœnician vessel, commanded by
a Roman named Vivian, of favorable reputation and experience.
She was staunch and large, having a tonnage
of about eight hundred tons, and rigged after the Phœnician
pattern, with a ponderous mast carrying a very large
mainsail upon a long yard. A much smaller triangular
foresail was rigged upon a bowsprit, which projected over
the stem of the vessel forward. She carried various
carved images and symbols designed to insure the favor
of the gods, including a finely wrought Grecian statue of
a favorite goddess, which was placed upon the stem-post
at the bow.
</p>

<p>
The hour for setting sail arrived, and everything betokened
a prosperous voyage. The decks were noisy
with the final bustle of preparation, and with much effort
the heavy anchors were weighed and secured in their
places. A light favoring breeze was blowing from the
south, and at length a lusty command rang out to <q>hoist
all sail;</q> and soon the canvas began to fill, and the good
ship drew steadily away upon her northward course.
</p>

<p>
Serenus and Amabel stood upon the upper deck, and
with mingled emotions looked back upon the picturesque
shore of Samaria which was slowly receding. Though
<pb n="253"/><anchor id="Pg253"/>exiles from the Holy City, the world was before them,
and they were happy. Without the enjoyment of freedom
of soul, even native land was but a prison.
</p>

<p>
The day wore away, the white towers and roofs of
Cæsarea faded from sight, and the bold range of Mount
Carmel, which formed the rim of the eastern horizon,
grew dim and distant.
</p>

<p>
The voyage was pleasant and uneventful, and upon
the fourth day they made the harbor of Salamis on the
eastern end of the island of Cyprus, where vessels from
the south usually touched on the way to Tarsus. This
was a large commercial city, made especially conspicuous
by its important temple of the Salaminian Jupiter.
Beyond the temple and city was a rich plain, encircled
by hills, and watered by the abundant streams of Pediæus.
As in other cities where the Jews of the Dispersion had
settled, there were several synagogues. During the day,
over which the Salapiæ remained, Serenus visited two or
three of them, making known the New Faith, and restoring
some sick-folk through the orderly working of the
divine power within him. He was cordially received by
the more liberal of the Hellenistic Jews, and they were
sorrowful at his departure.
</p>

<p>
Early the next morning the Salapiæ again set sail, and
it was expected that, with favoring winds, Tarsus would
be reached on the third day.
</p>

<p>
Everything went well until after they had rounded the
point of the promontory of Dinaretum, at the northeastern
extremity of the island, when with almost no warning,
the vessel was suddenly struck by a tempest of great
violence, throwing her nearly upon her beam-ends. It
<pb n="254"/><anchor id="Pg254"/>came with so little premonition that the sailors had
barely begun to lower the great clumsy mainsail when
it was rent in twain by the force of the wind. This
eased the vessel except for a list to the leeward, caused
by the shifting of the cargo. Shrieks, cries, imprecations,
and prayers to the gods were mingled with the roar
of the storm. So great was the panic that the master
found it difficult to maintain any semblance of order
among a crew which was made up of a mixture of different
races and tongues.
</p>

<p>
The air was thick with blinding spray, and the
stricken ship, like a wounded animal, staggered onward,
laboring and straining in the boiling sea. Heavy waves
washed the decks, and the soaking mass of shattered
canvas swung to and fro, its tattered shreds no longer
resisting the wind, which howled through them with a
thunderous roar.
</p>

<p>
<q>By Hercules!</q> quoth master Vivian; <q>if it <hi rend="italic">must</hi>
come, the gods were merciful in rending the sail, else
she would have foundered at the first stroke!</q>
</p>

<p>
The tempest was not an <q>Elisian,</q> as certain gales
from the northwest were designated in the Levant, but
blew from the southeast, from which quarter it finally
settled into a steady gale.
</p>

<p>
The immediate danger seemed to be past.
</p>

<p>
The remnants of the mainsail were gradually cleared
away, and the Salapiæ scudded before the wind, under
bare poles, with the exception of the closely reefed foresail,
which somewhat steadied her. After the decks were
cleared of rubbish, all hands were put to work to right
the cargo, which was done with great difficulty. The
<pb n="255"/><anchor id="Pg255"/>hoarse roar of the gale continued unbroken. It came
from a little to the east of south, which was in a direction
to drive them directly toward their destination, and
there was plenty of sea room which was much in their
favor. For their escape the gods were thanked in various
tongues, libations poured, and the commotion,
which had been so noisy, was quieted.
</p>

<p>
But anon a cry came up from the lower hold that the
Salapiæ was leaking. The first terrible strain of the
great mainmast had opened some of the seams, and they
were taking water. Once more there was despair upon
the faces of the bravest-hearted sailors. The gods of all
grades were again invoked, and vows renewed. But the
master believed in works as well as petitions.
</p>

<p>
<q>Bring out the cables!</q> he cried. <q>She must be
undergirded!</q>
</p>

<p>
With great labor a cable was slipped down over the
bow, being held from each side, and passed under and
back until it encircled the hull amidships, and then
another, and both were strained and fastened as snugly
as possible over the deck. It was a vain effort. If it
prevented a further opening, it did not stop the leak.
The pumps were put in motion with frequent relays.
</p>

<p>
Soon the eventful day came to an end, and the darkness
of night closed around them. The bellowing wind
held from the same quarter with no diminution, and the
speed, even with little canvas spread, was rapid. If the
leak gained upon the pumps, the only safety lay in making
Tarsus, and therefore the small amount of sail was
then increased as much as it would bear, and the Salapiæ
swept on before the wind.
</p>

<pb n="256"/><anchor id="Pg256"/>

<p>
Amidst all the confusion of tongues and conflict of
elements, Serenus remained calm and unmoved. Amabel
was at first disturbed, but after some reassuring
words from her husband, she remained quietly in the
cabin, performing such little services for the overworked
and panic-stricken sailors as were possible for
the delicate hands of a woman. A part of the time
Serenus was at her side, and at intervals he went out
upon deck to speak words of encouragement to officers
and men.
</p>

<p>
The master sent the second officer below to make
reports concerning the progress of the leak. There
was intense anxiety to learn whether the Salapiæ were
settling, or if the pumps were equal to the inflow.
</p>

<p>
<q>Two cubita,</q> came up in hollow but distinct tones
from below.
</p>

<p>
An hour then wearily passed, with the relay at the
pumps doing their utmost.
</p>

<p>
<q>Two cubita and one-eighth!</q>
</p>

<p>
As the report came to his ear through a small aperture
from below, the face of Vivian lost color; but despite the
news he went over to the pumps and gave words of
encouragement to the workers.
</p>

<p>
<q>By the Salaminian Jupiter, we shall win!</q> said he;
and then passing along, he ordered a part of the crew
to begin at once to throw the cargo overboard. He
said nothing of the report from below, but the significance
of the last order was understood by all. Over
the slippery, reeling decks they began with a will to
unload the Salapiæ.
</p>

<p>
They were still swept along with unabated speed.
<pb n="257"/><anchor id="Pg257"/>The few dim, moving lanterns, like fireflies in the blackness,
seemed to make the night thicker. The shrill
creaking of the pumps sounded like ominous groans of
prophetic woe as it rose above the steady, deep bellowing
of the gale.
</p>

<p>
Another hour dragged itself slowly by.
</p>

<p>
<q>Two cubita and a quarter!</q>
</p>

<p>
The night had hardly begun.
</p>

<p>
Their former enemy, the wind, now gave them the
most hope. But if it held, they could not hope to
reach Tarsus before the morning of the third day from
Salamis.
</p>

<p>
It was a race!
</p>

<p>
Which would win? the leak or the pumps?
</p>

<p>
The cool self-possession of Serenus greatly impressed
Vivian, and the master, recognizing him as a man of
uncommon character, confided to him the true state
of affairs.
</p>

<p>
Serenus was silent for a moment, and then replied,—
</p>

<p>
<q>With your leave, I would speak briefly with you
again in two hours.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As you will,</q> he replied, hardly knowing what he
said, and thinking the request of little importance.
</p>

<p>
Serenus returned to the cabin, and seated himself by
Amabel’s side, taking her hand in his own.
</p>

<p>
<q>Bride of my heart! the Salapiæ is in some peril!
Art thou repentant that thou left thy father’s house?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay, my husband! Whatever may betide, I am
joyfully with thee! But for thee my life would have
gone out before. Thou hast taught me that all things
work together for the best for such as have faith. I
<pb n="258"/><anchor id="Pg258"/>believe it! Even if our <hi rend="italic">bodies</hi> sink in the tumultuous
sea, <hi rend="italic">we</hi> will go on hand in hand, on missions of love
and mercy!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>God bless thee, dear Amabel! The growth in thy
spiritual consciousness hath been marvellously quick
and steadfast!</q>
</p>

<p>
A gentle smile and a warm pressure of his hand were
her answer.
</p>

<p>
<q>And now, dear Amabel! I would spend a little season
alone. Peradventure some light may come to me concerning
this present trial, its meaning and conclusion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Light of my life! may thou be truly exalted in the
silence.</q>
</p>

<p>
Amabel remained in the cabin, while Serenus retired
to their little room and closed the door.
</p>

<p>
The gift to lift the curtain which veils the future, in
varying degree, has come to a rare soul, here and there,
in all ages. But more properly it is not a favor, specially
bestowed from without, but a supernal attainment
<hi rend="italic">within</hi>,—an unwonted spiritual altitude. The prophetic
instinct lies deeply embedded in the soul of man, but
few there be who can strip away the thick coverings of
sense, so as to read the direction of the delicate needle
of the spiritual compass. Such a power is no miracle
in the sense of a change or improved action on the part
of the Unchangeable Perfection, but an orderly lifting
of the soul into a close communion with It,—the Divine
Mind. Through spiritual law, steadfast in its regularity,—of
which the world at large has yet had but fitful
glimpses,—events not only distant, but of the future,
are clearly laid open to highly attuned souls. History,
<pb n="259"/><anchor id="Pg259"/>both ancient and modern, is marked with such demonstrations
of the potency of a higher law. They are crowning-points
of light, like the few widely separated stars
of great magnitude in the black firmament of night.
</p>

<p>
There is a psychical unfoldment without its proportionate
spiritual counterpart, and there is a possible
reverse order; but it is the supreme and rounded combination
of <hi rend="italic">both</hi> which makes the true prophet.
</p>

<p>
Such was Victor Serenus.
</p>

<p>
He was in the little room alone—no, not alone. It
was his to climb the Mount of Transfiguration, and gain
a view from its summit.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
The great turbulent waves broke upon the Salapiæ,
making her quiver in every timber—but he felt it not!
The howling of the wind, groaning of the hard-pressed
pumps, and a Babel of voices rent the air—but he
heard them not. The peril which threatened every soul
on board steadily increased—but he knew it not. His
animate form reclined in the little room, but <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was not
there.
</p>

<p>
The embrace of the Infinite was about him!
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
As man reckons the time of the eternal now, nearly
two hours passed, when the door opened, and Serenus
made his appearance.

<p>
<q>Behold we draw nigh to our journey’s end,</q> said
the elder of two young men to his companion. <q>The
dark red summits of Sinai lift themselves in the distance
before us, and to-morrow’s sun, peradventure, will find
us in the shadow of a great rock!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The God of Israel be praised!</q> replied his companion.
<q>The shelter of the mountains will gladden our
hearts, and we may find water-brooks. It is a land of
promise, and rest and peace will be ours when we leave
behind this weary desert, thrice heated by the rays of
the Arabian sun!</q>
</p>

<pb n="261"/><anchor id="Pg261"/>

<p>
The first speaker aroused himself a little, and seemed
to gather new strength at the prospect. His pale face,
dark sunken eyes, trembling nerves, and evident weakness
of body and limb, spoke eloquently of extreme feebleness.
Yet, as he gazed forward, a new light came
into his eyes, as if a strong soul would spur on its
frame, and command it to live. It was Saulus!<note place="foot">
<p>Gal. i. 16, 17. Immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:
neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me;
but I went away into Arabia.
</p>

<p>
Says Canon Farrar in his <q>Life and Work of St. Paul,</q> <q>It is difficult
to conceive of any change more total, any rift of difference more deep, than
that which separated Saul the persecutor from Paul the Apostle; and we are
sure that—like Moses, like Elijah, like our Lord Himself, like almost every
great soul in ancient or modern times to whom has been intrusted the task
of swaying the destinies by moulding the convictions of mankind,—like
Sakya Mouni, like Mahomet in the cave of Hira, like St. Francis of Assisi
in his sickness, like Luther in the monastery of Erfurdt—he would need a
quiet period in which to elaborate his thoughts, to still the tumult of his
emotions, to commune in secrecy and in silence with his own soul....
Even on grounds of historic probability, it seems unlikely that Saul should
at once have been able to substitute a propaganda for an inquisition....
And so Saul went to Arabia—a word which must, I think, be understood in
its popular and primary sense to mean the Sinaitic peninsula.</q></p></note> He
was mounted upon a well-laden camel, while his companion
walked by his side. Hardly able to keep his
hold against the swaying motion of the animal, he clung
as with the grasp of desperation.
</p>

<p>
A shallow stream may easily be turned in a new direction,
but to change the course of one whose flashing
current is deep and swift is a herculean transaction. It
must tear away much material—rock, soil, vegetation,
and even trees by the roots, transforming them into
washed and swept <foreign rend="italic">débris</foreign>—before it can adjust itself to
new banks, and scour another channel. So a great soul
<pb n="262"/><anchor id="Pg262"/>of vehement force is an impetuous psychological river,
the reversal of which, if it be sudden, produces a spiritual
cataclysm.
</p>

<p>
If an eagle of powerful and sweeping wing be met in
his swift course, and drenched and battered by an opposing
storm of irresistible force, he must needs alight
a while upon solid ground, and through some quiet recuperation
plume his spent and drooping pinions before
again soaring aloft.
</p>

<p>
The world has witnessed few greater transactions than
the transformation of Saulus. No material conquest,
and no physical change in the face of nature, can be
compared with the reversal and resurrection of a great
mind. Well may it be called a <q>miracle,</q> if the old
illogical but common definition of the term be superseded
by one that is orderly and rational. Miracles are
lawful, not lawless. They are circles, of which an important
arc is above the limited range of the ordinary
observer. They are <hi rend="italic">super</hi>natural, in the sense of being
above the material and sensuous comprehension, but not
violations or suspensions of the universal Divine Order.
The Author of all things is never disorderly in his
methods.
</p>

<p>
In the psychological realm, as in the physical, while
there is a conservation of energy, there are also alternations
of action and reaction. When a great soul has
<q>passed through fire and water,</q> a condition of passivity
and silence naturally follows. When the black clouds
that have been rolled together by a great tempest have
dissolved, the torrents ceased, and the thunder died
away, then is sunlit nature unwontedly calm and
peace<pb n="263"/><anchor id="Pg263"/>ful, even though the marks and scars of the storm remain.
</p>

<p>
Saulus, sick at heart and wrenched in body, yearned
for solitude. It was an imperative necessity. As a
stricken deer by positive instinct leaves the herd, so
he must step out from the surrounding human current.
Rest, quiet, stillness! at any sacrifice! He was like a
tree which had been pulled up by the roots. His
wounds must have time to heal, and the torn fibres and
tendrils be soothed, refreshed, and readjusted. If the
foundations of a lifetime have been swept away, there
must be new excavation and bed-rock replacement. The
life of Saulus had been a tempestuous current of destruction
to the <q>Nazarenes.</q> Now <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was a <q>Nazarene</q>!
</p>

<p>
He, who had been so exceeding jealous for the doctrine
of Moses, would now be counted as the enemy of
Mosaism. But Moses, to his view, was transformed.
No longer the man of doctrine and ceremony, he was
now the <hi rend="italic">man of God</hi>.
</p>

<p>
Saulus was tossed and buffeted by restless waves,
though he now discerned solid land before him. He
must grasp the Immovable! He would discover <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>!
As Moses had been impelled to retire to the <q>land of
Midian,</q> where the bush glowed with a flame that did
not consume, and where he had communings with the
Most High, so Saulus must follow the same path.
</p>

<p>
During the process of the evolution of the human individual,
every one, sooner or later, must go to his <q>land
of Midian.</q> When the foundations of time and sense
begin to totter, the smaller unit must discover its place
in the Greater! Man will never find real contentment
<pb n="264"/><anchor id="Pg264"/>in a far-away or theoretical Deity, but he must grasp the
Living <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>. He is most readily known and felt, not
among the busy haunts of men, but in the wild solitudes
of nature. Amid such an environment, light may stream
forth, mysteries be resolved, wounds healed, shelter
found, and nourishment assimilated. In the <hi rend="small">SILENCE</hi>
is the fitting place for the human to bathe and refresh
itself in the Divine. At such seasons man may,—
</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 12">“Sit on the desert stone</l>
<l>Like Elijah at Horeb’s cave alone;</l>
<l>And a gentle voice comes through the wild,</l>
<l>Like a father consoling his fretful child,</l>
<l>That banishes bitterness, wrath, and fear,</l>
<l>Saying, ‘Man is distant, but God is near.’”</l>
</lg>

<p>
Among all the attendants who had accompanied Saulus
to Damascus, but one remained faithful to him.
Some of them thought him suddenly mad, and others
were minded to take him back to Jerusalem under arrest.
Their counsels were confused and came to naught. But
Amoz, the companion of his former disturbed nights in
the Holy City, though having but little appreciation of
his great change, remained personally loyal, and was
willing to go with him for a time, even in the wilderness.
He sympathized with his infirmities, and was
tender in ministration.
</p>

<p>
It was well along in the afternoon, after the midday
rest, during the terrible heat of the desert air, that the
two travellers started on the last stage of their wearisome
journey. A great arid sand-waste stretched away
on both sides of the narrow trail, with here and there a
few hardy shrubs and wiry yellow grasses which were
<pb n="265"/><anchor id="Pg265"/>stirred by the fitful summer air. As they advanced towards
the foothills of the mountain range, the landscape
became more broken by the numerous wadies which were
worn by the torrential mountain streams of the rainy
season, and there was an increased luxuriance of vegetation.
</p>

<p>
The Sinaitic peninsula is interesting both on account
of its topographical peculiarities, and historically in its
association with the giving of the Law, and other events
which are recorded of the wanderings of the Children
of Israel in the Wilderness. Between the gulfs of Suez
and Akaba, this bold mass of mountains, lying south of
the great desert of Ettyh Paran, projects itself well into
the Red Sea.
</p>

<p>
It was thoroughly apart from all the world’s highways,
cities, and towns—a veritable corner of the earth,
surrounded by sea and desert. Its lofty reddish-brown
frowning peaks looked down upon a vast solitude. They
were generally precipitous, having many fissures, hollows
and caves around their bases, forming a shelter from
the heat of the sun, and convenient even for dwelling-places
most of the year. Amid these mountains, hermits
anchorites and pilgrims found a lonely resort fitted to
their desires.
</p>

<p>
As the travellers went on, the ground was more broken,
the valleys deeper, and the tangled reeds and grasses
greener and more varied. The trail led into a wide,
shallow wady, the bed of which was still soft from recent
rains, and as they toiled along the slow ascent the
verdure thickened. An occasional oleander in bloom,
tangles of climbing vines, scattered mulberry-trees, with
<pb n="266"/><anchor id="Pg266"/>here and there a palm, now gladdened their sight, in
marked contrast to the barren wilderness which they
had left behind. They soon found themselves among
low bluffs and cliffs, with here and there a tiny stream
of clear water springing from the cracks of the fissured
rocks.
</p>

<p>
The whistle of quail and the whir of partridges, with
the song of the lark and rock-sparrow, greeted their ears,
and other birds of various hues uttered their notes and
flew away as they were startled from their reedy coverts.
Anon a sly fox or frightened jackal was seen galloping
in the distance. They had emerged from heat, bareness,
and deadness into the region of living things. The sun
was declining, and the cooler air, with a great change
in the face of nature, gave Saulus some increase of
strength and hope.
</p>

<p>
At length a beseeching moan from the patient dromedary
reminded them that the end of day was near, and
that the hour for encampment and rest had come. Soon
a gentle decline of dry, grassy ground was at hand.
Amoz gave the camel the signal to kneel, and then
carefully supported Saulus in his arms as he dismounted.
He had little strength left, but yet his eyes, which had
been fixed and dreamy during the day, kindled at the
new and more inspiring surroundings, and the prospect
of much-needed repose. Amoz deftly spread a soft carpet
upon the grass, and tenderly placed Saulus upon it,
where he could recline while the preparations for the
night’s encampment were being made.
</p>

<p>
As the ship is to the sea, so is the camel to the
desert, and his noiseless stepping and rhythmical
careen<pb n="267"/><anchor id="Pg267"/>ing make the likeness a striking one. The full load
and equipment of the awkward brute embraced all the
endless variety of necessities for nomadic life. Boxes
and bundles were hung over his broad back and secured
by straps and girths, so that everything was snug and
convenient. The harness included some color and embellishment,
the bridle being trimmed with scarlet
fringe, and upon the throat-strap was hung a row of
tiny tinkling bells, besides other trappings, knots, and
variegated ties, which made up a picturesque combination.
Pride, care, and even affection are lavished upon
the faithful beast, without whose aid life and travel
in the desert would be well-nigh impossible.
</p>

<p>
From among the paraphernalia which formed the
dromedary cargo, Amoz drew a large circular camel’s-hair
cloth, with a bundle of rods and a light strong pole.
The frame was joined and the pole planted, and with
the cloth fastened over them, a tent, small, but ample
for a person to stand upright in, was soon constructed.
This, with the grassy carpet beneath and other accessories,
formed a nomadic home quite complete for the
air of Arabia.
</p>

<p>
From pouches and willow baskets Amoz brought forth
materials for a meal. There were dried and smoked
meats, dates, pomegranates, wheaten wafers, honey,
cheese made from goat’s milk, and wine in skin gurglets.
These, with fresh water from a near-by spring in
the cliff, made a comfortable repast. The camel was
groomed, and given a store of water, of which, for
three days past, the desert had not afforded a drop.
</p>

<p>
The moist freshness of the air and neighboring
ani<pb n="268"/><anchor id="Pg268"/>mal and vegetal life, with the fact that he was near
his journey’s end, stirred some new life in the veins
of the sore and bruised Saulus, and for the first time
in years there seemed to be nourishment and rejoicing
in his immediate environment.
</p>

<p>
The sun was slowly sinking in the western horizon,
his parting beams brilliantly lighting up the deep-red
and purplish summits and cliffs of Sinai, which were
now in near and full view. As Saulus gazed upon
them they seemed almost instinct with life and weird
mystery. Especially the towering heights of Horeb
were eloquent with ancient sacred story. The great
cluster of lesser peaks stood up like gigantic living
witnesses of distant events, and brought them near.
When in times gone by Saulus had read the records
of the scenes which here had transpired, they seemed
dead and formal, but now they teemed with life.
</p>

<p>
Darkness drew on, and with crowns newly silvered
by the rising moon, these great silent sentinels told
anew their mute story. Was <q><hi rend="smallcaps">I am</hi></q> here? He who
had led the Children through this land, who handed
down the Law to them, whose thunderings made them
tremble and whose lightnings terrified them? The
Past is a part of the Present. If <q><hi rend="smallcaps">I am that I am</hi></q>
dwelt here of old, he is not less present now. And
those great souls, Moses and Elijah, who aforetime trod
these solitudes, gazed upon these cliffs, and tabernacled
in Horeb—do they, unseen by the eye of sense, ever
revisit these scenes?
</p>

<p>
Do the generations which follow each other in quick
succession repeat in endless round the same
experi<pb n="269"/><anchor id="Pg269"/>ences, again suffer the same trials and meet the same
obstacles, or do they learn new lessons, make fresh advances,
and dwell upon higher levels? Is the ancient
code of stern legality, the close mechanical limitations
of <q>Thou shalt not,</q> to be gradually set aside by the
true ideal of a positive spiritual freedom, faith, love,
and good works?
</p>

<p>
As the shades of evening thickly gathered, Saulus
looked up towards the shining firmament which testified
to the infinite and unchangeable perfection of the
Divine. Surely, God and his ways can neither improve
nor grow old; but the seeming alteration in his dealings
with the children of men must be in their own varying
moods and short range of vision. Here his meditation
was suddenly interrupted.
</p>

<p>
He was seized with his nightly trembling fit, with
its usual accompaniment of direful fears, forebodings,
and tragic visions of the past. Every evening brought a
recurrence of these nervous spasms, which rudely broke
in upon him at the same hour, regardless of how he
might be occupied. His agony was fearful to behold.
With loud groans he cried out to the living God for
forgiveness and release.
</p>

<p>
<q>O God, spare me! Cleanse me from this awful
blood-guiltiness! O Jesus of Nazareth, have mercy!</q>
</p>

<p>
There trooped in terrible procession before his mind
the forms and faces of many innocent ones whom he had
scourged and tortured. In the chill of a cold perspiration
he cried out and implored that his eyes might be
closed against a repetition of the scenes of the Holy
City, but nothing could shut them out. With contortion
<pb n="270"/><anchor id="Pg270"/>of face, shaking of limb, and agony of soul, at length
he sank, from thorough exhaustion into enforced quietude.
After gradually reviving and recovering, he remained
free, until the next evening again ushered in the
same terrible experience.
</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 12">“A thousand fantasies</l>
<l>Begin to throng into my memory,</l>
<l>Of calling shapes, and beck’ning shadows dire,</l>
<l>And airy tongues that syllable men’s names</l>
<l>On sands and shores and desert wildernesses.”</l>
</lg>

<p>
Amoz faithfully ministered to the necessities of
Saulus, tenderly soothing him with brotherly sympathy,
until long-sought quietude settled upon the little tent
for the night.
</p>

<p>
The deep scars of sin and crime only can be healed
by slow growth. The well-worn thought-channels of a
mind which has done violence to laws of its own divine
being cannot be filled and levelled by any sudden
change of belief or doctrinal transformation. Well
would it be for the world, if once it could be convinced
that cause and effect can no more be severed
upon the psychical and spiritual planes than in the
material realm. There is no short cut or evasion in
the moral economy. Nothing on earth can put away
a state of consciousness in man but the growth of a
different one, which only may gradually and lawfully
displace it. It cannot be driven out forcibly or quickly.
Character is formed of thought-habits, and their exercise
and dominance give them ever increasing rigidity.
A renewing of the mind consists of its activity projected
into a higher realm. When the leading trend
<pb n="271"/><anchor id="Pg271"/>of a soul is discordant with the divine order and primal
love, the outcome is sure to be a moral wrench
difficult to repair.
</p>

<p>
The early morning sun again gilded the brown and
deep-red peaks of Sinai, and Amoz was up betimes to
prepare the simple morning meal, and make ready for
the remaining short journey.
</p>

<p>
The high ground upon which they had encamped
afforded a wide view to the eastward, and the sweet
and moist morning air and dewy freshness made the
broad expanse seem like a newly discovered paradise.
In the distance the broad blue Gulf of Akaba reflected
the golden beams of the rising orb of day, gleaming
like a great opalescent sea of pearl, while in the dim
purple distance beyond arose the misty Arabian peaks
which skirt its farther shore. The morning was a benediction,
and the world seemed peaceful and good. Nature
glowed with life and cheer, and the early lights
and shadows capriciously chased each other up and
down the mountain-slopes in unending procession. The
cloud-forms which gracefully floated over the grim summits
seemed to correspond, in their fleeting evanescence,
to the passing generations of men which these
silent rock-ribbed witnesses had looked down upon, as
if they had been a slow-moving but endless caravan.
</p>

<p>
Is anything in the universe fixed and enduring? Yea,
the immortal life of man! He whose material existence
is like the flitting cloud-shadows possesses a real
selfhood that will expand and develop when yonder
solid peaks shall have dissolved to dust and found
their lowest level.
</p>

<pb n="272"/><anchor id="Pg272"/>

<p>
Saulus felt new strength and inspiration from the
breath and fragrance of Nature that smiled upon him.
The beautiful surroundings, or rather the great exuberant
Life which pulsated through them, seemed to
warm his soul, and cause a bursting forth of the inmost
springs of his nature. The hard, formal religiosity,
which like an unyielding shell had long encased him,
was beginning to soften and gradually disintegrate before
the force of the new spiritual current in his soul.
</p>

<p>
After the morning meal was finished, and the camel
had been fed, groomed, and harnessed, the light tent
was struck, and it, with the other paraphernalia, loaded
upon him, they started, Saulus riding in his place, and
Amoz walking, as was his wont. Two or three hours
more and they would be at the foot of Horeb,—their
journey’s end. Why were they going there? Amoz had
often put this question to Saulus, but no response had
been offered. He did not refuse to answer from any
unwillingness, but was unable to divine any definite plan
even to himself. Something seemed to draw him. Was
it blind fate? Nay! he was guided by a spiritual instinct,
strong but gentle, soft though unerring. He could
not fathom it.
</p>

<p>
From the time of leaving Damascus, through all the
weary days in the terrible desert, there had been no
wavering nor uncertainty. Unseen guidance shaped the
pilgrimage in every detail, mysterious even to its chief
actor. A path opened before him, and he felt drawn
to follow its devious winding. While he had a general
purpose, he felt that its definite unfoldment was
provided for by that which was superior to himself.
<pb n="273"/><anchor id="Pg273"/>He desired to go for a season beyond the haunts of
men, and to breathe the pure air of heaven, but the
particulars were plainly none of his. Could it be a
divine guidance? He had always believed that the
orderings of Jehovah came through outward signs, thunderings
and miracles. An earthquake or a tempest
might have been interpreted. But what of this still,
gentle influence within him? What could move a soul
which had been the noisy arena of warring forces and
tumults? But this seemed to well up from the very
depths of his being. Could it be God?
</p>

<p>
Had a line been stretched all the way from Damascus
for him to follow he would have gone no more
unerringly, but yet, mystery though it were, he felt subject
to no pressure.
</p>

<p>
How many souls have vainly sought the world over
to find the Infinite,—the Universal Good,—and have
finally discovered him in their inmost nature! They
have delved through history, roamed over continents,
visited holy places, searched through creeds, scanned
philosophies, sounded the depths of ecclesiasticism,
traversed the circumference of systems and institutions,
and bowed to the authority of priest and ritual, only to
discover at last the divinity of the real selfhood,—that
inner light which is set for the teaching of <q>every man,
coming into the world.</q> How many have looked high
and low, and cried, <q>Lo here</q> and <q>Lo there,</q> who
needed only thorough self-interpretation! How many
inmost and potential <q>sons of God,</q> through the misdirection
of the imaging or creative faculty of soul,
have unwittingly cast their own shadows as sons of
<pb n="274"/><anchor id="Pg274"/>Belial, and thereby accepted the dominance of evil!
How many, through the glamour of a formal and institutional
plan of salvation, have unconsciously covered the
hidden and normal divinity of humanity! How many,
through an artificial and abnormal humility, have rated
themselves as <q>poor miserable sinners,</q> and as a natural
consequence been subtly drawn, through a moral
pessimism, toward the outline of their own specification!
</p>

<p>
Two hours of early morning travel brought Saulus
and Amoz to the rock-ribbed base of Mount Horeb.
The cooling shade of trees and shrubs, the fresh fragrant
air, and the grand outlook as they came upon the still
more elevated ground at the foot of the great cliff, gave
Saulus a strange sense of detachment from the earth.
He felt an unwonted spiritual upliftment and exhilaration
which was a revelation. The surrounding sweetness,
the silence, broken only by the song and twitter
of an occasional bird, descended like a healing balm
upon the stained and scarred soul of the erstwhile
inquisitor.
</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 14">“No tears</l>
<l>Dim the sweet look that Nature wears.”</l>
</lg>

<p>
The great <q>Mount of God,</q> firm and unchangeable,
looked down with mystical and compassionate dignity,
as if to bear witness to the touch of things eternal; to
invest the soul of the observer with a divine awe, perchance
again to unroll for the instruction of Saulus the
great Drama of the Chosen People.
</p>

<p>
The narrow trail which had been followed the day
before had gradually faded out or lost itself in various
<pb n="275"/><anchor id="Pg275"/>disused paths which branched in different directions,
and now the twain found themselves close against the
precipitous side of the mountain.
</p>

<p>
<q>Verily we must turn to the right or the left,</q> said
Amoz, <q>for we can go no farther. But here is a cool
and shady thicket. Let us go beneath its shelter and
rest a while.</q>
</p>

<p>
Guiding the camel skilfully, they threaded their way
into the clump of blossoming oleanders and mulberry-trees,
soon coming to a mass of clinging vines which
concealed the face of the great overhanging cliff in
front. Amoz helped Saulus to alight, and the faithful
beast uttered a cry of joy as he awkwardly kneeled for
the removal of his load. The equipments were soon
unladen, and there was a feeling that the long, wearisome
journey was at an end. In the midst of such
verdure and freshness the toilsome days in the desert
seemed only like a troublesome dream which had almost
faded out. The face of Saulus brightened, the dark
rings around his eyes were less heavy, and he felt some
increase of strength.
</p>

<p>
<q>The mysterious Voice which speaks within me still
commands, <q>Go forward!</q></q> said Saulus.
</p>

<p>
<q>But, O my brother, we are close against the Mount!
How can we go farther?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I know not! But still its tone is clear, <q><hi rend="italic">Go forward!</hi></q></q>
</p>

<p>
Amoz left Saulus for a moment, and carefully made
his way through the tangle, to spy out, if possible, the
immediate foreground. He brushed aside the climbing
vines, and found himself face to face with the solid
<pb n="276"/><anchor id="Pg276"/>rock. He was just about to turn back, when his eyes
rested upon something which had the general form of
ancient Hebrew text. The lapse of ages, with the moist
atmosphere, had well nigh covered it with a luxurious
growth of velvety mosses, but he could not be mistaken.
</p>

<p>
<q>The hand of man hath wrought this!</q> he exclaimed
to himself; and without waiting to make any further examination
he hurried to inform Saulus.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold, O Saulus! the cliff hath been graven by the
hand of man!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will go with thee, and peradventure we may give it
interpretation!</q>
</p>

<p>
As it was close at hand, Saulus, with the assistance
of his companion, found no difficulty in working his way
through the vines to the impenetrable barrier of stone.
Amoz quickly cleared away the tangle, and then stripping
off the mossy hangings, an inscription stood before
them in bold, deeply engraved Hebrew characters,—
</p>

<p rend="center"><q><hi rend="small">GOD IS HERE</hi>.</q></p>

<p>
Saulus and Amoz instinctively removed their sandals,
and bowed their faces to the ground. They felt a Presence
surrounding them. The place was holy ground.
The very trees, vines, and leaves seemed to breathe forth
a fragrant benediction. To the inner eye they glowed
with brightness and were not consumed. After a season
of silent adoration they arose and reverently made
further examination. They found other carvings and
symbols, mystical in form, which they were unable to
interpret.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of a surety, the Voice which guided us hither is
<pb n="277"/><anchor id="Pg277"/>none other than the Voice of God!</q> said Saulus. <q>In
the fulness of time it will make everything plain!</q> he
continued with confidence.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, I also am persuaded that thy footsteps have
been divinely led to the Holy Mount. Here we will
tabernacle until thou hast recovered thy strength.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am already stronger! The Voice will guide and
help me! Behold, I have found God!</q>
</p>

<p>
His eye kindled with a new light, and his features
were suffused with an unwonted vigor and life. He
trembled, not with the fulness of fear, as in the nightly
spasms, but with a thrill of joy.
</p>

<p>
O wondrous mountain! O wondrous world that pulsates
with the breath of God! O mystery of mysteries!
God meets men face to face!
</p>

<p>
Reverently brushing back more of the tangle, and carefully
removing the velvety covering, they beheld another
inscription,—
</p>

<p rend="center"><q><hi rend="small">GOD IS ETERNAL LOVE AND LIFE</hi>.</q></p>

<p>
Saulus was lifted to the supremacy and sublimity of
a new, triumphant faith. He felt the sweet certainty of
something nobler and purer than he had ever conceived;
a gladness that nestled in his heart, making it warm and
tranquil. He had no favor to ask or petition to make of
the Divinity which embraced him, for his soul was filled—satisfied.
There was no lack. Enswathed in the Eternal
Presence, he could crave no more.
</p>

<p>
Every branch and twig and leaf seemed to be tipped
with a lambent, gleaming light which shone upon him.
The whole Vision smiled, and the Voice gave him a
wel<pb n="278"/><anchor id="Pg278"/>come, until with bated breath and throbbing heart he
had a sense of leaving the body, and rising and being
encircled by a golden aureole.
</p>

<p>
With eyes upturned, the bodily form of Saulus sank
quietly back until he lay stretched upon the soft, mossy
couch beneath him. The seen world faded out amidst
the uprearing of a transcendent ecstasy.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
Amoz sat by his side, wondering at the experiences of
the great soul which he had seen so variously possessed.
A smile played upon the upturned face of Saulus as he
lay, calm and unconscious, in the cooling shade. Was
there a prophetic gleam of future power and glory? Was
there some dim foretaste of an Apostolic energy, which
should reach, not merely one race, but possess a moulding
influence upon the world? Had he been carried
up in a Chariot of Fire to an altitude where he could
look out over the Future, and rapturously behold the activity
of unseen forces and intelligences, through whose
final triumph the kingdom of universal love and harmony—that
at-one-ment of the Divine and Human—is
to be ushered in?
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
At length Saulus opened his eyes and sat upright.
He said nothing of the Vision, for it was unspeakable.
</p>

<p>
Hand in hand Saulus and Amoz stood up and drew
nearer to the great rocky Breast, which reached almost
perpendicularly far up beyond the range of their vision.
Again they essayed to decipher and interpret the
mys<pb n="279"/><anchor id="Pg279"/>terious signs and symbols which were clustered about
the plain sentences already read, but in vain.
</p>

<p>
Then they noticed a peculiar series of small characters,
which extended to the right, behind the tangle.
Following its lead, and carefully clearing away the vines
and leaves which covered its farther course, there was
soon revealed a great cleft in the rock. It seemed to
lead directly into the heart of mighty Horeb, and was
broad enough to admit a laden camel. A light, cool
breeze was issuing from within, and the entrance was
smooth, dry, and inviting.
</p>

<p>
With an eager and expectant air the two young Hebrews
entered side by side, and were soon beyond the
light of the outer world.

<p>
The commander of the Salapiæ anxiously paced the
dark, slippery deck, occasionally halting to encourage
the sailors, or direct in the movement of some heavy
piece of the cargo which was to be cast overboard, to
lighten, so far as possible, the stricken ship. The shrill
creaking of the pumps, as they were unceasingly worked
in the prevailing darkness, sounded as might the sighs
and moans of malignant fiends, who were derisively gloating
over the rich prey of which they already felt sure.
</p>

<p>
Another signal from below caught the quick ear of
Vivian, and he proceeded to the small tube which led
down to the hold, and bending over he heard in sepulchral
tones,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Two cubita and a half!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The gods be merciful!</q> he exclaimed to himself.
<q>Nothing less than their interposition can save us!</q>
</p>

<p>
The hoarse vibrations of the surrounding tempest were
<pb n="281"/><anchor id="Pg281"/>mingled with its shriller tones produced by its hissing
sweep through the shattered spars and rigging, all combining,
like the different instruments in a great orchestra,
to render a grand minor symphony of Woe and
Despair.
</p>

<p>
By great exertion they were able to raise a little more
canvas, as the only hope lay in making Tarsus, or some
other port on the Cilician coast, toward which the wind
was sweeping them. Though much more distant than
Salamis, which they had left behind, there was no choice.
They could go only where they were driven. The gods
were invoked and libations poured, that the gale, which at
first had brought them disaster, might continue. Could
they make Tarsus before the Salapiæ would fill and go
to the bottom?
</p>

<p>
The panic and confusion which had prevailed among
the crew of many races gradually subsided, and a grim
desperation settled down upon all. Each worked with
a dogged, sullen intensity, as though the fate of all
depended upon his own persistency of effort.
</p>

<p>
To actually face death sometimes seems to inspire a
kind of stolid indifference. Even to the ignorant and
worldly man the vital fact comes home that it can come
but once, and that, after all, the peculiar time and means
of the most universal of all human experiences are not
so very important. The divine economy of the human
constitution is such that when the great Fact looms up
in the near foreground, there is often an unwonted serenity
and confidence that are lacking in lesser trials, or
even in its own more distant anticipation.
</p>

<p>
Deep down beneath the perturbed and noisy surface
<pb n="282"/><anchor id="Pg282"/>of human consciousness there is an inherent and instinctive
faith in, and recognition of, the righteousness
and even beneficence of that which Is and Must Be.
Only a merciful Providence could have provided that the
life-long fear of meeting the <q>King of Terrors</q> should
measurably fade out upon his near approach.
</p>

<p>
Whatever may betide, every man feels, in the profound
recesses of his heart, that he will be justly dealt with,
and that the natural penalty for his misdeeds should
not be shunned, and that perhaps in some way it is well
that it should come. The artificial, dogmatic, and superficial
elements drop away, and a divinely implanted
subconscious sense of universal equity, and even love,
finally comes to the surface and makes itself felt.
</p>

<p>
Man feels that he is to be fairly weighed, and will
inevitably find his own moral and spiritual specific gravity.
The universe is so ordered that he will invariably
measure himself, for it is best that he should. He that
is condemned is self-condemned. True, he regrets his
own manifold mistakes, selfishness, and sensuous degradation.
Their penalties will surely scarify him, and
make up his beneficent hell, through which he must
pass, either here or hereafter, in order to purification.
Metals are only purged of their dross by being cast
into the crucible.
</p>

<p>
Salvation must be the result of free moral character,
and that must grow from within, for it cannot be imposed.
This fundamental principle underlies all surface
religions, dogmatisms, and systems.
</p>

<p>
The Salapiæ plunged dizzily onward. Amid the swash
of waves upon the deck, and the swinging to and fro of
<pb n="283"/><anchor id="Pg283"/>the tattered remnants of sails which kept time to her
staggering rhythm, a few dim, moving lanterns, like fitful
fireflies, were all that could be discerned.
</p>

<p>
Vivian never lost courage and composure, though he
recognized that the race between the leak and Tarsus
included only a bare possibility of reaching the latter,
the probabilities being an hundred-fold in favor of the
former.
</p>

<p>
It was past midnight when Serenus emerged from the
little cabin where he had been in the silence—with the
Universal. His mien was calm and confident, and his
face radiant with a sense of inner reserve and spiritual
upliftment. He first sought Amabel, who was patiently
awaiting him. There was no trace of care on her beautiful
face, and she greeted him with a warm embrace.
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it well, my husband?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is well, Light of my life! We shall be brought
safely through this trial, and it will prove a blessing to
many. While I am persuaded of the result, I wot not
in what manner the escape will come.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is the sea cruel and treacherous, or does the trial
come for our sifting and testing?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The sea is good, even though it now seem contrary.
Trials come in the ordinary course of things, and seeming
adversity is the <q>Adversary</q> which appears so that
we may grow through the process of overcoming him.
Satan is the Tester, or negative Developer, of man. But
for trials and obstacles, life would become stagnant and
unprofitable for lack of exercise. Behold, the glory of
the latter end of Job was the result of an experience in
which the Adversary had an important office.</q>
</p>

<pb n="284"/><anchor id="Pg284"/>

<p>
<q>But surely such a trial as this tempest is not a thing
to be sought?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay, verily! We are not to go into temptation, or
seek for trial! Only such testing as comes from beyond
our control can minister to our discipline and profit.
Having faithfully followed our highest inward guidance,
everything that comes will, in some way, be transformed
into blessing.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O my beloved! I feel that what you say is true, but
yet it seemeth to be a great mystery. Hark! behold the
tempest hath a sound like the roaring of lions!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hast thou forgotten the record of Daniel? His uplifting
faith closed the mouths of the lions of his day!
These will be closed also! Behold it is our inner and
secret enemies that are most besetting. It is not the
angry roar of the tempest that threatens, but the still,
hidden leak. But deliverance from both will come!
Yea, we may exclaim, not God be merciful, but God is
merciful!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I believe it! How glorious!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I rejoice that thou dost not doubt. But go now and
rest, while I seek the master of the ship.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Go, for God is with thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
With much effort Serenus lifted the cover of a small
hatchway, and passed out upon the dark, storm-swept
deck. The violent pitching, noise, and blackness were
forbidding; and had he not been free from the bondage
of appearances, he would have quailed at the prospect.
At length he found Vivian, who was much surprised.
</p>

<p>
<q>How camest thou here?</q> said the master. But before
Serenus had time to answer, he continued,—
</p>

<pb n="285"/><anchor id="Pg285"/>

<p>
<q>But now I am minded of thy purpose to see me
again. Thou art welcome, and I count thee to be discreet;
but before I hearken to thy message, I must tell
thee that unless a miracle take place, the Salapiæ will
go down, and all on board perish!</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus was silent for a moment, and Vivian continued,—
</p>

<p>
<q>I must leave thee straightway, until once more I
make inquiry concerning the water in the hold! But
soon I will return.</q>
</p>

<p>
He left Serenus clinging to one of the smaller masts,
and slowly made his way to the speaking-tube to get
another report. In response to his signal, hollow tones
full of direful prophecy came up,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Three cubita full!</q>
</p>

<p>
The pumps were doing their utmost, and the master
fully realized that the contest was hopeless. But he
was brave.
</p>

<p>
Heroes are not the exclusive product of any one time,
race, or religion.
</p>

<p>
He said nothing to the crew of the increasing peril,
but with cheerful tones encouraged their efforts. Skilfully
guiding his course to the place where Serenus was
waiting, he said,—
</p>

<p>
<q>O Hebrew! though thou art young, I am persuaded
of thy wisdom. Speak now, and I will listen to thy
message.</q>
</p>

<p>
The darkness was so dense that neither could behold
more than the dim outlines of the other’s form, and the
noise made conversation impossible except as their
faces were almost together. Each put his hand upon
<pb n="286"/><anchor id="Pg286"/>the shoulder of the other, while they steadied themselves
by the mast. But both were as serene as if they were
basking in the summer sunshine upon a favored shore.
</p>

<p>
<q>The Salapiæ will be lost, but every soul on board
will be safely landed in Tarsus!</q> said Serenus.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou speakest in no uncertain tone, O wise young
Hebrew! Whence hast thou this knowledge?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O noble and brave Roman! only by the fulfilment
of my prophecy can its truth be proven to thee. I ask
thee not to believe, and am well persuaded that thou
wilt abate no effort for salvation because of my assurance.
Nay, I would have thee use the utmost diligence;
for man must employ all the means, and fully
co-operate with God in working out his own salvation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hast thou inquired of the God of the Hebrews and
received this favoring answer from him?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My vision of the future cometh not from the special
God of any race or tribe, but through the power which
the universal Divine Spirit, that ruleth the world and all
its elements, hath conferred upon man to read and interpret
his laws.</q>
</p>

<p>
Vivian, though a man of much worldly wisdom, but
dimly understood the meaning of Serenus, but yet deeply
felt the superiority of the man who stood face to face
with him. There was a positive spiritual influence and
hope which came from contact with the young man which
he could not divine.
</p>

<p>
<q>Wilt thou not acquaint me more fully of thy power?
How canst thou read the fate of the Salapiæ, and that
none on board of her shall perish, except that thy God
hath given thee some visible token? And if thou hast
<pb n="287"/><anchor id="Pg287"/>received a sign, surely thou mayst show it me and reveal
its significance. I would fain believe it, yet how can I
be assured?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou art well skilled in the sailing of ships, and I
will not question thy wisdom in thine own calling; but
in a way of which I cannot tell thee, and which thou
thinkest not of, every soul on board will come safely
to Tarsus!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The gods grant that thy words may come to pass,
but thou hast offered me no sign. I would that I had
inquired of the oracle in the great temple of the Salaminian
Jupiter. But thou dost count thy God greater
than Jupiter?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, he is the God above all gods! He is the All
in All! His laws and methods are orderly and universal!
His wisdom and love are already perfect, and
we need not importune him to change his plans. We
approach him, not by vain oblation or libation, but by
communion and oneness of spirit. We lift ourselves into
harmony with his beneficent and eternal order. Even
the laws which produce wind and wave are good, but to
narrow and perverted human vision they often appear
evil.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But surely thou wilt tell me more of thy prophecy,
and by what means thou didst receive the message?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold I was about to acquaint thee with that!
The divine wisdom hath placed within the nature of
all men certain prophetic spiritual instincts, but they
are yet latent, except in a few souls who have been
inwardly illumined. Favored in my lot and experience,
some of this inner clear-sightedness hath come to me.
<pb n="288"/><anchor id="Pg288"/>At certain times and seasons it enableth me to behold
that which is commonly invisible, and also, not only
to foretell some events of the future, but verily to
see them. This power cometh not by any special and
miraculous bestowment, but through an inward unfolding,
and an understanding of the law of inspiration.
Thou hast the same power in thyself, but it hath not
yet been awakened. Thou wouldst know how I, or
rather the spirit that is within me, is assured of our
safety! I answer, that though it hath not yet come to
pass, yet in my retiracy this night <hi rend="italic">I have seen every one
safe in Tarsus</hi>!</q><note place="foot">If Paul, under similar circumstances, was able to foretell the result of
a shipwreck, as related in the Biblical narrative, why should not an equally
gifted and illumined soul in like manner be clear-sighted? The higher perception
in man is an orderly attainment rather than an unearned supernatural
bestowment.</note>
</p>

<p>
The master of the Salapiæ was attentive and interested,
but not convinced. But the earnest sincerity
and indefinable charm of the young man’s presence
almost persuaded him against his will.
</p>

<p>
The Roman and Hebrew stood in brotherly embrace
amidst the roar and darkness, but one represented the
seen and sensuous, and the other the unseen and real.
Man, to the first, was only a visible and animated
form; to the second, he was a spiritual entity, even
though now possessing material form and expression.
To one, when he sank beneath the waves, it was his
end; to the other, the <hi rend="italic">man</hi> was intact. To the latter,
the sinking, at the worst, could be but an unmoral incident;
not an evil, as that term conveys ethical quality.
Drowning could neither take away from, nor add to, the
<pb n="289"/><anchor id="Pg289"/>real man or his character. The loss of one mode of
expression does not touch the ego.
</p>

<p>
<q>What counsel dost thou offer me?</q> inquired Vivian.
</p>

<p>
<q>In the conduct of the ship, none! Abate not one
jot of the labor at the pumps, and diligently employ
all thy skill and watchfulness in the use of other means
which thou deemest wise. My converse with thee is
that of man and brother, but as master of the Salapiæ
none can question thee.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold thou hast great charity and a loving spirit!</q>
exclaimed Vivian. <q>I have heard many of thy race
revile us as outcasts and idolaters, while they called
themselves the chosen of heaven.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou art my brother, even though thou understandest
not my faith, and we are all sons of the Most High
God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Verily such a saying mine ears never before have
heard! Thou dost me too much honor! With all my
diligence to please the gods, I have always counted
myself as a man subject to error and passion!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>While thou hast made many mistakes, and hast much
to learn, thou art inmostly a child of Goodness; and
as thou dost come to thy veritable self, thou wilt discover
thine own likeness to the Divine Father!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Surely thou art more than a Hebrew, for thy religion
is noble! Deeply hast thou persuaded me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Think no more of thyself as a man who is in subjection
to evil; for it hath been truly written, that <q>as
a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.</q> The thought of
one concerning himself fills and shapes his inner life.
Feel thyself to be a son of God, and such a
conscious<pb n="290"/><anchor id="Pg290"/>ness will renew and purify thy soul. Behold, the world
knoweth not this law! The old self with its deeds
will drop away, while the new man will be formed
within, and his outward works will answer to the inner
thought-ideal. Thus the visible expression will be the
index of the pattern that is held in the heart!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I marvel at such a doctrine, and yet feel its truth.
Hath any man yet filled to the full the divine measure
of which thou hast spoken?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, there hath been a Man of Nazareth, of Judea,
born a Hebrew, who recognized the perfect human
divinity. He is the Ideal, not only for his own nation,
but for all the world, whether Greek, Roman, Jew, barbarian,
or Scythian! He knew the inmost oneness of
God and man, because he knew himself as he was.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Where is he now? How I would like to see him!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Because he was so large in his love, he was hated
and crucified by his own people,—my people,—and
passed into the unseen.</q>
</p>

<p>
In answer to many more questions, Serenus then gave
Vivian a brief account of Jesus, the Christ, his mission,
and the quality of his life. The twain, amid the hissing
of the elements and the groaning of the pumps, stood
in the thick darkness, with their arms affectionately
around each other in brotherly communion.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou hast touched me deeply,</q> said Vivian. <q>I love
thy spirit, and rejoice that we have met! I thank thee
that thou hast brought me a knowledge of the Ideal,—the
Nazarene; so noble, so large, and so beyond race
and outward condition! He will fill an uninterpreted
longing of my whole life. I shall think of him even
<pb n="291"/><anchor id="Pg291"/>during our peril. Behold thou hast made me feel that
there is something in us, of which the tempest, at its
worst, cannot rob us. Would that I could have seen
the Ideal!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou mayst do even more, for thou canst feel his
spirit within thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have it, and it shall possess me!</q>
</p>

<p>
Vivian expressed a tender and earnest thankfulness,
and they parted long after midnight.
</p>

<p>
The next morning brought no occasion for hope. The
water in the hold steadily increased, and the gale showed
little abatement. In every direction there was nothing
but an endless gray waste of boiling waves, which
seemed hungry and impatient to swallow up the stricken
ship. The weary hours of the second day dragged along
with interminable slowness, and the impenetrable gloom
of outward conditions had no ray to lighten it. The
strain and fatigue brought such a torpor of stolid indifference
upon the crew, that to some death would have
been almost welcome. Desperate but wholly unsuccessful
attempts were made to draw down some remnants of
sail upon the outside to lessen the inflow, but the water
in the hold gained with fateful certainty.
</p>

<p>
As the day finally wore away, the force of the tempest
slowly lessened, making their progress less rapid. Even
at the present rate, it would be impossible to reach
Tarsus before the middle of the following day, and a
careful survey made it a matter of great doubt whether
or not the Salapiæ could float until the next daybreak.
</p>

<p>
The master again called Serenus upon deck, giving
him an affectionate greeting.
</p>

<pb n="292"/><anchor id="Pg292"/>

<p>
<q>O my brother! unless peradventure a miracle be
wrought, I can discern no manner of means for the fulfilment
of thy prophecy! I wot not how the Salapiæ in
any wise can reach the desired haven. But while I cannot
descry the end of thy good message, I have joy in
thinking of the Ideal, and of feeling an earnest of the
same spirit within.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I rejoice with thee that thou dost recognize the
living Witness!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But O most worthy brother and prophet! peradventure
we be saved from this present peril, some other expedience
will yet bring us to our end. How sayest thou?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is no end! If my prophecy prove vain, and we
sink in the depths of the sea, behold that spirit which is
within us, and which <hi rend="italic">we are</hi>, hath continuance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It seemeth to be a great mystery!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold thou hast a body, but art not body! Thou art
spirit even now. If thy seen form dissolve, thou wilt still
live, even though in the invisible! Thou wilt see, but
not with these eyes; thou wilt hear and feel, but not with
these members; yea, thou wilt think and know and
love!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have heard of shades beyond the Styx, but counted
them to be only shadows. Dost thou affirm that they
are verily ourselves?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea! of a surety! When thou goest out of thy tent
or house, art thou not the same? Behold the unseen
country is all about us, and peopled with those who have
laid off the flesh. As our garments wax old and are laid
aside for those more befitting, so are we clothed with
such bodies as belong to the place of our sojourn.</q>
</p>

<pb n="293"/><anchor id="Pg293"/>

<p>
<q>Unto what canst thou liken them?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Our habitations beyond the Styx, as thou sayest,
are such as we are now building by our thoughts, desires,
and loves. Even though unseen, we are uprearing
and putting them on day by day.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In what manner art thou persuaded of these things?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The Voice within giveth its testimony concerning
them, and moreover, those that are yonder have sent
back messages. It cometh to pass also that certain
who are still with us have their inner sight opened, so
that those who are invisible become manifest. If thou
wouldst know of that whereof I speak, open thy soul and
become like a little child, and the silent voice within
will yield some growing assurance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I believe that I already hear its still, sweet utterance!
Unto this day it hath been asleep, but thou hast
aroused it, and it will live!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou givest good tidings! behold the spirit of the
Christ—the son of God—in thee is coming into manifestation!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O thou greater than a Hebrew! thou hast discovered
me to myself. I joyfully accept thy teaching and prophecy,
for of a truth thou hast a wisdom beyond that of
earth!</q>
</p>

<p>
The master of the Salapiæ always had been brave and
manly, but now there was a light in his eye and a joy in
his heart which was unwonted, even when no peril threatened.
It was not so much the words which Serenus had
spoken, but the spirit and love which filled him, and
which he radiated, that had taken hold of the Roman.
</p>

<p>
The gloom of another night was gathering, and the
<pb n="294"/><anchor id="Pg294"/>Salapiæ was visibly deeper in the sea. But as the
blackness closed around the sinking ship, there was no
more joyful soul on board than Vivian. Amidst all the
stress and danger his greatest wonder was himself.
</p>

<p>
Down, and still lower down, the helpless wreck heaved
and plunged heavily during the second night. Would
daylight ever come?
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
At last the morning dawned, and they were still afloat.
The storm had ceased, and the sun arose clear and bright
from the eastern sea. The wind which had driven them
so strongly towards Tarsus had entirely died away, and
a light breeze was coming from the opposite direction.
They were able to hoist more sail, but being obliged
to tack, the progress of the water-logged ship became
hardly perceptible.
</p>

<p>
Tarsus was now not very distant, but every soul on
board clearly saw that the Salapiæ never could reach
the wished-for port. Slowly, but with grim certainty,
the water in the hold deepened, and direful Fate, with
cruel footsteps, was silently approaching.
</p>

<p>
The faith of Serenus and Amabel never wavered.
Even that of Vivian was firm and confident. But he
neglected no feasible effort that belonged to his calling,
and made all possible preparations for what seemed to
be immediately impending. The ship’s boats had been
swept away during the first assault of the storm, but with
all diligence two rafts had been hurriedly constructed
of such materials as were at hand, and some provisions
and gurglets of water and wine lashed to them. But the
<pb n="295"/><anchor id="Pg295"/>waves were still high, and would wash over them if they
were launched.
</p>

<p>
While there were no cries of confusion, as upon the
first day of the storm, petitions were being offered, and
vows made in various tongues to gods of different names.
</p>

<p>
The human mind at its greatest can grasp but an
infinitesimal fraction of the Infinite, but it always has a
deific ideal which fills its utmost capacity. No two ever
possess quite the same, but to the individual it is the
highest, and all there is. To it he must cry, and upon
it he must stay himself, for he cannot go beyond.
</p>

<p>
But the Infinite dwells in every man’s ideal, however
low. It is the link, unseen and perchance crude,
which draws and binds him to the Eternal Goodness.
Let us respect the supreme pattern of every human
brother, though he be ignorant, simple, theologically
untaught, or even vile. For <hi rend="italic">him</hi> it must stand until a
greater and purer takes its place. The <q>Father’s
House,</q> even though provisional and unshapely, is hidden
within the deep mists of every human soul.
</p>

<p>
But look! The city of Tarsus, with its white roofs
and gilded towers, is now dimly visible in the far
distance.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
The day was perfect. As if in repentance of her
past angry mood, Nature arrayed herself in her most
beautiful robes. The air was of crystalline clearness,
and not a cloud specked the blue azure above. During
the morning hours the sea gradually calmed down, and
the reflected sunlight gleamed and danced upon the crest
<pb n="296"/><anchor id="Pg296"/>of every billow with sparkling brilliancy. From the
Salapiæ the vast expanse seemed to be the embodiment
of Treachery outwardly dressed in living Beauty. With
cruel spirit, but seductive charm, it was stealthily waiting
to take mortals into its cold embrace forever.
</p>

<p>
The ship could not possibly last until midday. The
adverse breeze freshened, and her labored progress almost
ceased.
</p>

<p>
But look again! A speck appears upon the water near
Tarsus, and it slowly, oh, how slowly, grows larger.
It was described as some kind of a ship under full
sail, and under the favoring breeze it was soon evident
that her approach was rapid. She was a fast
sailer, and the style of her rigging was that of a pleasure
<foreign rend="italic">bireme</foreign> rather than a merchantman. The freshening
breeze rendered her oars unnecessary. Every one except
those at the pumps strained his eyes in that direction.
</p>

<p>
Hope kindled in every breast, and hearts beat quickly.
</p>

<lg>
<l>“Oh, welcome, pure-ey’d Faith, white-handed Hope,</l>
<l>Thou hovering angel, girt with golden wings!”</l>
</lg>

<p>
The strange craft was of graceful model, and with
every sail set her sharp prow cut the waves as she moved
like a graceful bird in rapid flight; and yet how slowly
the distance seemed to diminish! But new hope was
new life! The men at the pumps received an endowment
of herculean strength. Signals of distress were
hoisted and responded to, and the beautiful ship steered
directly for them.
</p>

<p>
The Salapiæ was now so low that she might go down
at any moment. It was like a race in the games of
<pb n="297"/><anchor id="Pg297"/>Olympia, where the runners were full abreast as they
neared the goal.
</p>

<p>
Now the strange sea-bird flies rapidly! See! she is
rounding and coming alongside! What a beautiful spectacle,
and how graceful her approach! She is built for
pleasure and racing.
</p>

<p>
The rail and trimmings about her deck were brilliant
with burnished metal, and her prow was surmounted
with the graceful bronze statue of a Tarsian goddess.
Upon her peak floated a silvery purple banner, heavily
wrought with golden figures, representing various emblems
and symbols in the Temple of Apollo. All her
splendid appointments indicated that she must be owned
by some one of patrician rank and great wealth. She
came near. The name of the pleasure ship was discerned
as the Nereid.
</p>

<p>
<q>We will save you!</q> cried the master in a loud voice.
<q>Behold our boats! They will take off every one!</q>
</p>

<p>
Before Vivian had time to express his gratitude, the
small boats were already lowered, and in a short time
every one on the Salapiæ was safely transferred to the
gayly decked <foreign rend="italic">bireme</foreign>. All were most hospitably received,
and their necessities kindly ministered unto.
</p>

<p>
Vivian told the commander of himself, and of the
Salapiæ, and made known Serenus and Amabel as his
honored friends. The master of the pleasure ship then
indicated his desire to present them to the owner, whom
he said was a Roman of noble family, and Vice Legate
of Tarsus. They had chosen the fine morning for a
pleasure excursion.
</p>

<p>
Descending a short flight of stairs, Vivian, Serenus,
<pb n="298"/><anchor id="Pg298"/>and Amabel were ushered into a cabin of goodly size,
at the farther end of which were two men sitting at a
table, evidently engaged in playing some kind of a
friendly game. One was tall and straight, with long
black hair, heavy eyebrows and lashes, and full beard,
of dignified bearing, and features of the Roman cast.
The other was rather slight and effeminate in personal
appearance, with wavy brown hair, dark blue eyes, luxurious
in costume, and an air of polish and refinement.
The first was the Roman, Marcius, and the other
Leander the Greek.<note place="foot">Both introduced in the <ref target="Pg017">third chapter</ref>.</note> After a brief exchange of polite
greetings and congratulations, they all ascended to the
deck to ascertain the fate of the Salapiæ. They were
none too soon; for in a moment, with a great surge, she
was received into the full embrace of the hungry sea, the
billows closing over her forever.

<p>
Saulus and Amoz advancing into the cave found it
dry and capacious, and also well lighted for some distance
from the entrance. A long-continued cleft upward
in the face of the rock freely admitted the outer air and
daylight, and also sunlight at certain hours. The walls
on either side gave evidence of previous human habitation,
being marked with various inscriptions, symbolic
characters, and drawings. In the deeper recesses the
darkness increased, and various intricate passage-ways
opened into curious ramifications and apartments of indefinite
extent. The temperature was comfortable, and
the atmosphere pleasant.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold a favored habitation already prepared for
us!</q> said Amoz. <q>The wisdom of the Voice is now
made manifest!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, of a surety it hath guided us to this place, and
here we will abide!</q>
</p>

<p>
Amoz returned for the camel, and soon led him to the
<pb n="300"/><anchor id="Pg300"/>entrance, where he was unladen, and after a little delay
a convenient place in the cave was selected for him.
Before the shades of evening fell everything was well
arranged for a stay of indefinite length.
</p>

<p>
The silence and seclusion seemed delightful, and even
paradisaical to the restless and depressed soul of Saulus.
The world, with its unending strifes and jealousies, its
warring creeds and religious persecutions, and all the
surge and sweat of human passion, was far away.
</p>

<p>
Often, above all things, man needs a face-to-face interview
with his real self, in order that he may interpret
the hidden springs of his own being, sound the
intricate deeps of his primal nature, study ideals, and
survey foundations. A life devoted entirely to the Objective,
even if its ends be worthy, lacks an understanding
of those subjective mental and spiritual reservoirs
which is indispensable to harmonious development.
</p>

<p>
No one can avoid companionship. But objective personalities
supply but a small part of the innate craving
for intimate good cheer and friendliness. Whether or
not consciously chosen, the ego must have a supremely
close communion with its own thought-forms,—its veritable
creations. As a duplicate selfhood it is firmly
linked to them. If man must carry this secondary man
with him, what sort of a character shall he be? His
fellow-men, with whom he daily mingles, though seemingly
near, are infinitely distant when compared with
his own self-made mental environment,—his real world.
</p>

<p>
Every man is like an artist who is sentenced to dwell
with his own pictures, so hung that they continually
stare him in the face. But especially when from choice
<pb n="301"/><anchor id="Pg301"/>or necessity one for a season turns aside from his accustomed
Objective, he finds intimate relationship with
his subjective structures of the past. He is forced to
a careful inspection of his own stored-up images, and it
is woeful if they frown upon him. All the hates, envies,
and antagonisms that he has ever projected are turned
in upon himself. They surround and threaten him, and
their growls are disquieting. He thought they had been
sent away, but their accumulated recoil was only postponed.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, all the loves, harmonies, and hopes
that have been sent out, now possibly forgotten, rise up
out of the misty deep and send back a smile, and return
affection with added interest. They are lived over
again.
</p>

<lg>
<l>“Music, when soft voices die,</l>
<l>Vibrates in the memory.”</l>
</lg>

<p>
Heavens and hells are stored up in the chambers of
the soul, and if perchance diversion for a time may
seem to bury them, their resurrection and visitation
surely follow in due course.
</p>

<p>
But as Saulus looked in upon himself, he found that
he could increasingly choose and control those things
that should mentally dwell with him. With all his
cruel impetuosity of the past, his life had not been
devoid of good thoughts and deeds, and these he struggled
to keep in review. But vastly greater than all else,
when the dark Past marshalled itself before him, he
turned to the Present God. How unlike was the God
he found in Horeb to the tribal Deity he had served in
the Holy City! The difference was in his own vision.
</p>

<pb n="302"/><anchor id="Pg302"/>

<p>
Often he would sit for hours with eyes closed and
body relaxed, in silent communion with the felt Presence.
At such times he realized a positive influx of
sweetness and strength from the Universal, which
thrilled him in mind and body.
</p>

<p>
The crust of his former hardness was breaking up, and
his soul was growing childlike and plastic. The rigid
dogmatism and intolerance in him, which for so long had
been impenetrable to the Spirit of Truth, were dissolving,
and love and wisdom were opened up, as water from
a fountain whose seal had been newly unloosed.
</p>

<p>
Saulus marvelled as much at the seeming change in
his God as in the transformation in himself. That
Deity who had rejoiced in persecution, and been angry
and jealous, was now the Author of love, peace, and
concord. It was clear that his former concept of God
had been but a telescopic likeness of himself.
</p>

<p>
The cave at Horeb proved to be a most agreeable
place of abode, and Saulus found in his seclusion some
of the happiest days of his life. Though the evening
experiences of weakness and trembling seemed to have
become a fixed habit, and scars and strains in soul and
body were present as the legacy of the past, there was a
gradual gain of vigor. The expanding soul was coming
into a knowledge of its intrinsic divinity and oneness
with the Father, and this reflected and expressed a growing
wholeness.
</p>

<p>
Amoz, with the camel, made some explorations in the
adjacent region; and about two hours distant, at a crossing
of some of the more important paths, he found a
small station of a few huts, where supplies could be
<pb n="303"/><anchor id="Pg303"/>replenished, and occasional communication had with the
outside world.
</p>

<p>
But what was the world of the past to Saulus? It
seemed as if he was severed from everything that had
gone before, and had built a new world for himself.
His own transformation was vastly greater than the
change from the Holy City to the cave. But he had no
intention of becoming a hermit. He would, for a time,
gather his resources, and firmly knit the sinews of his
soul, in preparation for future conquests for the truth
among men. The mistakes and enmities of the past he
would bury beneath a mountain of love and good-will
which should brighten the world.
</p>

<p>
But what of past personal ties and obligations? First
of all, what of little Cassia? What of his ardent affection
and faithful promises to her? Was his love, which
formerly was so consuming, yet alive and burning
brightly? Did she stand out in lifelike proportions in
his new world, or had her image largely faded out of his
heart? What had she heard of him? and what would
she think?
</p>

<p>
There were hours when these and similar questions
thrust themselves upon Saulus with terrible force. The
intense and all-absorbing love of Cassia, her unbounded
confidence in him, and his former rapt devotion to her
in return, stood out before him in letters of fire.
</p>

<p>
One evening his period of suffering, which he had already
named <q>a stake in the flesh,</q> left him in a strange
condition of unrest and uncertainty. The thought of
Cassia filled him with something like its old-time intensity.
Questions crowded themselves upon him, and
<pb n="304"/><anchor id="Pg304"/>clamored for an answer. But while the little maiden
of the Sheepmarket still occupied a very warm place
in his heart, with it was mingled a peculiar sense of
ever-widening distance.
</p>

<p>
He put himself on the witness-stand,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Am I not a different Saulus from he who aforetime
loved Cassia, and to whom she was so devoted?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Has this new and larger love driven out my affection,
or only for a time overshadowed it?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is she really fair and good, or did I deceive myself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Can my love ever again be so all-absorbing?</q>
</p>

<p>
Yes and no were both echoed as responses through
the troubled mind of Saulus. Opposing emotions marshalled
themselves, and in confusing alternation took
possession of him. For a little time he forgot the cave
and all its associations in the fierce play of the contending
forces.
</p>

<p>
But as the hours of the eventful evening wore away,
the thought of Cassia gained the ascendency. The very
inscriptions of ancient lore upon the walls seemed to
melt into her name, and yield a fragrance of her personality.
</p>

<p>
At length a peculiar quietude slowly settled upon
him, but he felt that it was not sleep. An unwonted
lightness of soul and an ethereal consciousness subtly
crept in and possessed his senses. The solid walls of
the cave became unsteady, as if about to dissolve, but
there was such a charming naturalness in the change
that it did not much surprise him.
</p>

<p>
<q>Surely I am not dreaming!</q>
</p>

<pb n="305"/><anchor id="Pg305"/>

<p>
<q>Of a verity, I believe that I am out of the body!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What lightness! what freedom!</q>
</p>

<p>
Soon he found himself standing beside his own prostrate
form. He clearly looked down upon the features—<hi rend="italic">his</hi>
features! The eyes were lightly closed, the lips
slightly parted, and the breast rose and fell but feebly
with the movement of the breath. Otherwise the body
was still.
</p>

<p>
<q>What a mystery!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have I died?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>No! that cannot be, for I—no, not I, for <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am
here—but my body yonder is manifestly animate. How
easily <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can move!</q>
</p>

<p>
All feeling of strangeness soon wore off. Simply
from force of desire he rose in the air for a short distance,
and looked down upon his material counterpart
as one would view a sleeping comrade. What wonderful
liberty and power before unknown! No wings were
needed to move through the air as he might choose.
</p>

<p>
Amoz, wide awake, was sitting quietly near the dim
lamp, but saw nothing unusual, believing that Saulus
was asleep. Though the little lamp gave but a feeble
light, the cave, to Saulus, seemed filled with a soft but
brilliant illumination. Considering the unwonted powers
and resources at his command, he was surprised at
his own lack of surprise. His senses were extended
and sublimated to a wonderful degree. He then tried
to attract the attention of Amoz, but received no recognition.
Not to be baffled, he took hold of him, and
finally shouted in his ear, but with no effect.
</p>

<p>
Then Saulus began to wonder. He could see and
<pb n="306"/><anchor id="Pg306"/>hear, but not be seen or heard. He moved about the
cave and made some further exploration, and found that
the solid walls were no obstruction. They were not
solid. He could not only see through them, but pass
through.
</p>

<p>
Then the thought of Cassia, which had been so strongly
present before, again became uppermost. But something
of the same uncertainty within himself regarding her
still remained.
</p>

<p>
Realizing that desire was all that was now needed
for propulsion, he came to a sudden determination.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will go up to the Holy City, and once more behold
Cassia, and all the things that I left behind.</q>
</p>

<p>
With the speed of thought, he left his own body,
Amoz, and the cave behind him, and passed out from
the mountain over the desert, and on, on, unerringly,
by the power of simple volition. Space and time were
limitations of the past.
</p>

<p>
How <q>cabbin’d, cribb’d, and confined</q> is man when
weighted down with the little load of dust which he
has picked up, moulded, and for a brief season carried
about! To him chasms of time and space are wide
and unbridgable, and he travels his little round with
barriers on every hand, and an ever-present sense of
servitude.
</p>

<p>
But it is not the grosser body <foreign rend="italic">per se</foreign> which is so
much his real encumbrance as his false consciousness
concerning it. He is steeped in a prevailing and ever-ruling
materialism. He is enslaved because he is ignorant
of the laws of his own independence. He not only
lives in the thought that it—the body—is I, but also
<pb n="307"/><anchor id="Pg307"/>bows in subjection to those ever-varying conditions,
which with chameleon-like accuracy shadow forth, in
exact expression, the quality of his past composite of
thought. The consciousness which he has carelessly
or ignorantly taken on, both racially and individually,
makes it his tyrannical master. Sometimes, smarting
under its rule, he has turned and denounced it as bad,
and hence a gloomy and destructive asceticism. This
is no less a mistake than a garish and overwrought
materialism.
</p>

<p>
Everything is useful, and everything <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, when not
misplaced. Evil is therefore not made up of the real
quality of things, but of their misplacement in the mind
of man. But the very misplacement is educative. So
rapidly as the human mentality through evolutionary
friction is rectified, the whole cosmos falls into line.
Then the nothingness of evil, as an entity, will be made
manifest. At present it is the name of a condition of
relativity.
</p>

<p>
Psychical experiences, unshackled by the supposed
necessary limitations of body in past ages, having been
exceptional, have been counted as supernatural, abnormal,
or only imaginary. The present age, with its scientific
spirit, its broad toleration, and its recognition of
the reign of law in every realm, increasingly finds that
they are merely subtle links or aspects of the Universal
Order. When their causation is traced, their normality
observed, and their utility understood, the weirdness
and seeming abnormity which have been put upon them
will be removed from the human lens, and the true place
and use of uncommon phenomena become evident. So
<pb n="308"/><anchor id="Pg308"/>long as they are regarded as strange, uncanny, or in
some degree unsound in scope or tendency, they are
made gratuitously harmful through the quality of thought
concerning them.
</p>

<p>
With desert and mountain left behind in his flight,
Saulus found himself at the portal of the Sheepgate of
the Holy City, ready to enter.<note place="foot"><p>The Biblical narrative repeatedly confirms the supposition that Paul
was, by nature and experience, subject to trances and visions, or, as translated
into modern parlance, he was a <q>psychic.</q> It is evident that this,
in legitimate form, is not inconsistent with Apostolic devotion and spiritual
attainment.
</p>

<p>
The recorded experience of Swedenborg’s departure from the body during
a trance, and witnessing a large fire in Stockholm, three hundred miles distant,
may be mentioned as an illustration in this line, among thousands with
which history abounds. While in Gottenburg on the 19th of June, 1759, he
saw and described in detail the progress and final control of the conflagration,
which was afterwards completely verified.</p></note>
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
The city lamps flickered here and there, the gates were
still open, and the throng passing in and out as was
wont. The shifting panorama of people of various
races, dialects, and costumes, pouring through the massive
arched portal with the general din and confusion,
were all so familiar, that Saulus almost forgot himself
in the midst of an environment so long habituated. He
stood for a few moments in a retired corner, striving to
recall the strange thread of his eventful past, and then
joined the current which was entering the city. His
sense of ethereal lightness continued, and he walked by
mere easy desire without effort. Quickening his pace,
he accidentally came in sharp contact with a Roman
guard who had charge of the gate, and who was rapidly
<pb n="309"/><anchor id="Pg309"/>going in the opposite direction to order it closed for the
night. He involuntarily stopped to apologize, but was
momentarily surprised to find himself utterly unrecognized.
Then, halting for a moment, he surveyed his
own bodily proportions, and they seemed as usual. But
anon a sense of his newly recognized powers flashed
upon him, and he passed on without further hindrance
or obstacle.
</p>

<p>
What security and immunity!
</p>

<p>
He could see and hear everything, but did not attract
attention, and could not if he would. Following the
well-worn thoroughfare, he soon came to the inn, and
turned and entered. He passed by Almon, who with
some companions were in the courtway, and continued
to the family apartment, but seeing nothing of Cassia he
ascended to the roof, thinking that she might be in her
wonted corner. The moon was shining brightly, and
every well-known object stood out in bold relief, but
Cassia was not there. Then he bethought himself that
she was presumably in her own apartment. He hurried
down the stairway, where every step was like an old
acquaintance, and coming to the entrance, easily passed
in without any movement of the closed door.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
Cassia was seated upon a low divan, and near by, upon
a small table, stood a lamp which had burned out for
lack of oil. But, as in the cave, a strange soft light made
everything clear to Saulus.
</p>

<p>
Her lithe, shapely form was wrapped in the ample
folds of an easy <foreign rend="italic">négligé</foreign> robe, and her long tresses fell
<pb n="310"/><anchor id="Pg310"/>behind in careless profusion over her comely white neck.
She sat with one hand pressed against her childlike
face, which was paler than was wont, her elbow resting
upon the small table at her side. Her downcast eyes
were swollen and red from weeping, her heart beating
quickly, and a long-drawn sigh escaped from her lips as
Saulus entered. He was distressed by her changed appearance.
The happy smile which formerly played upon
her delicate features had been replaced by a sorrowful,
drawn expression, and the erstwhile full ripe red lips, so
carelessly parted, were pale and compressed.
</p>

<p>
<q>How changed! Is this really you, Cassia dear?</q>
</p>

<p>
He seated himself by her side, and taking her hand
in his, pressed it to his lips, and then, with a reverent
air, gave her a kiss upon the forehead. She felt it not.
Then he gazed into her eyes, hoping in vain that once
again there might be reflected some image of himself.
</p>

<p>
Her manner was abstracted, and soon, with deep emotion,
she began talking to herself,—
</p>

<p>
<q>O my Saulus! Where art thou? and what evil hath
befallen thee? Behold thy Cassia weeps for thee and
cannot be comforted. Shall I mourn thee as dead?</q>
</p>

<p>
Saulus listened in agony, but could not make his presence
known. Every word cut him to the heart.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will not believe the tidings that have come to me.
Some say that thou hast become a lunatic, and some that
thou wast smitten by the sun and died, and others that
thou hast joined the hated Nazarenes. Peradventure
they are all lies! O Saulus! I am persuaded that thou
art still faithful. I wot not but that thou art sick or in
peril! O Saulus! why dost thou not return?</q>
</p>

<pb n="311"/><anchor id="Pg311"/>

<p>
Then she arose and paced to and fro in the little
apartment, and Saulus beseechingly followed her. She
spoke once more,—
</p>

<p>
<q>O my loved one! I feel almost that thou art here!
Something like thy sweet breath came upon my cheek!
Nay! my imagination doth deceive me!</q>
</p>

<p>
Then she sat down and buried her face in her hands,
and burst into fresh weeping.
</p>

<p>
Saulus could endure the scene no longer. Thrilled
and overwhelmed, he withdrew in like manner as he had
entered. In the effort to calm himself he visited some
of the other apartments.
</p>

<p>
After satisfying himself that his father, mother, and
Rebecca were no longer in the Holy City, he again ascended
to the roof and sat down, if possible to quiet his
distress. Soon he grew more peaceful. He looked up
into the starry firmament, far above the local and temporary
scenes of turmoil and disappointment, and stillness
came into his soul. The intensity of that which
had been near and present was merged into a living
sense of the broad, the Real, and the Universal. The
personal affection which had been so narrowly centred,
was submerged in a love that was all-embracing.
</p>

<p>
With a tranquil feeling of strength and inclination,
and without any conscious passage of time, he found
himself again in the cave at Horeb, and everything as
he had left it. He sought his quiet, prostrate form, with
which he had all the while been connected by an invisible
spiritual cord, and with a quick but indescribable
pang repossessed his corporeal frame, opened his eyes,
and sat upright.

<epigraph><p>
Truth, when stripped of the masks and stains that have been unwittingly
put upon her, hath a fair countenance, and all who behold
her inner beauty thus revealed, have a drawing in their hearts towards
her.
</p>
</epigraph>

<p>
The blue sparkling waves closed over the grave of the
Salapiæ with no sigh of repentance, their sportive play
having suffered but a moment of interruption. Tears
filled the eyes of Vivian as she disappeared, but soon
he regained his wonted composure. From long-continued
intimacy she had seemed almost a living thing, and he
had regard for every plank and spar which pertained to
her. Now she was gone forever.
</p>

<p>
But mingled with the sense of loss there was a great
joy, not only on account of the assured safety of every
soul which had been under his care, but that the prophecy,
for its own sake and that of Serenus, had been so
signally verified. He hailed it as a positive sign and
confirmation of the wisdom of his friend, and still more
of the power of the New Faith which had been awakened
within him. To his belief was added demonstration.
</p>

<p>
The weather being fine, the little group, at the invitation
of Marcius, were seated under a canopy upon the
upper deck of the Nereid, while refreshments were being
prepared for them below. The graceful galley, with
<pb n="313"/><anchor id="Pg313"/>a favoring breeze and every sail set, was now speeding
along towards Tarsus.
</p>

<p>
<q>The gods be thanked that I sought the sea to-day,</q>
said Marcius.
</p>

<p>
<q>Verily we are thankful, and fully persuaded both of
the wisdom and goodness of thy choice,</q> replied Vivian.
</p>

<p>
<q>By Pallas! it doth seem strange! I had already
directed the oarsmen to make ready the small barge for
an excursion up the Cydnus, and was almost in readiness
to depart. But a mysterious impulse seized me to
change the plan, and to order the Nereid to be manned
for a day’s cruise instead. Something well nigh like a
voice importuned me to <q>put out to sea,</q> and I obeyed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A truce to thy superstition,</q> said Leander. <q>Thou
art always eager for mystery, and unable to believe thy
senses. I rejoice in thine altered purpose, and that
through it our friends can continue their sea voyage,
instead of taking a rough one over the Styx; but verily,
thy fancy hath become unruly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O faithless Greek! thou believest nothing! Thou
shouldst deny that the wind ever bloweth because thou
canst not see its color and shape! I am persuaded that
oracular voices are not alone in temples. Peradventure
the gods whispered to me!</q>
</p>

<p>
Leander shrugged his shoulders, and good-humoredly
smiled, with a derisive air.
</p>

<p>
<q>Shades of Pluto! only children and women believe
the unbelievable!</q>
</p>

<p>
Marcius was undisturbed by the reckless sarcasm of
his friend, and calmly continued,—
</p>

<p>
<q>He who limits his belief to the testimony of the
<pb n="314"/><anchor id="Pg314"/>senses is a fool, and only lightly skims the surface of
life. What sayest thou, Master Vivian?</q>
</p>

<p>
The flight of years had wrought an important change
both in the character and social position of Marcius, but
the improvement in Leander was much more superficial.
</p>

<p>
The mysterious meeting face to face with Alethea in
the <foreign rend="italic">adytum</foreign> of the Temple proved to be an important
event in the experience and pursuits of the Roman.
After the weird night of that notable judgment and
warning, which through beautiful but terribly earnest lips
were wafted from the realm of the Unseen, he had become
a man of higher ideals. Though fond of races,
athletics, and sports in general, the overt vices of former
years fell away, and he grew thoughtful, reserved, and
even kindly in his disposition. Being of patrician lineage,
and possessing excellent native ability as well as
great wealth, he had, by the imperial edict of the Emperor
Tiberius, recently been appointed Vice Legate of
Tarsus and its outlying provinces, so that he was now
next in rank to the Roman governor. After the reign
of Tiberius he was continued in the same position by
Gaius, and still afterwards by Claudius.
</p>

<p>
While he formally continued such outward devotion to
the Roman and Tarsian deities as was customary in Tarsus,
there had grown to be a depth and seriousness in
his life which was unwonted for the period, and far removed
from the grossness of his earlier years. Though
having but a dim appreciation of true spiritual attainment,
yet the corrupt and sensuous worship of the time
became increasingly unsatisfying. He openly avowed to
his friends that to his certain knowledge human life was
<pb n="315"/><anchor id="Pg315"/>unbroken by the dark passage of the Styx, and that
character and consciousness continued. Aside, however,
from a light round of official duties, his time was largely
given to wholesome amusements. But this did not prevent
some irregular study of Greek lore, and a little
familiarity with the higher ancient philosophy.
</p>

<p>
Although Leander was now outwardly respectable,—as
the term went in Tarsus,—there was a growing distance
between the two friends which was plain to both.
Marcius permitted the continuance of some intimacy
because of former friendship, and also that his influence
might be helpful to the volatile Greek.
</p>

<p>
Vivian gave his unqualified assent to the question of
Marcius, and added,—
</p>

<p>
<q>O my lord! my good friend Serenus hath much
wisdom concerning the philosophy of life, present and
future, and hath taught me to my great profit.</q>
</p>

<p>
Marcius cast an inquiring but rather incredulous look
upon the young Hebrew, and observed,—
</p>

<p>
<q>I am glad that thou art a philosopher! I have many
questionings which disquiet me. Peradventure we may
reason together with profit. Pardon my inquiry, art thou
a Greek?</q>
</p>

<p>
The question was natural, as Serenus showed but little
of the distinctive Hebrew physiognomy, and especially as
philosophical inquiry and speculation were more common
among the Greeks than any other nation. However, his
fair and almost youthful appearance had little in common
with the usual characteristics of a typical sage.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am a Hebrew, though a native of Alexandria,</q> replied
Serenus modestly.
</p>

<pb n="316"/><anchor id="Pg316"/>

<p>
Marcius showed a little surprise; for his contact with
the Hebrews of Tarsus had made them seem abhorrent
and bigoted, and the supposition that an Israelite could
be different was new. His sly, sarcastic look of unbelief
expressed as plainly as words could have uttered,—
</p>

<p>
<q>A philosophical Hebrew! A curiosity indeed!</q>
</p>

<p>
But quickly suppressing any appearance of disrespect,
and noting the noble and manly bearing of Serenus, he
politely continued,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Pardon me! I have in no wise much knowledge of
your people, but have had the feeling that their philosophy,
and religion also, consisted of a foolish round of
ceremonialism, and that their devotion is paid to one
poor and exclusive tribal deity. And have they not an
exceeding contempt for all other religions and peoples?</q>
</p>

<p>
With dignified calmness Serenus replied,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou judgest not unrighteously, my lord Marcius. I
would that it were altogether different.</q>
</p>

<p>
Marcius was pleased with the serene manliness of
Serenus, and turning to Vivian remarked,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Of all Hebrews, thy friend is the only one whom I
have ever known in whose eyes everything peculiar to
his own people did not seem wholly righteous.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Though born a Hebrew, I am persuaded that he discerneth
the inner goodness of all men,</q> replied Vivian.
</p>

<p>
<q>If he showeth that kind of a spirit, I shall be glad to
listen, even if I do not believe his teaching! Where, O
Serenus! hath thy doctrines been taught, and in what
school hast thou found thy philosophy?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In my early youth I was a pupil of Philo of Alexandria,
and afterwards sat at the feet of the Rabban Gamaliel
<pb n="317"/><anchor id="Pg317"/>at Jerusalem. But with all due honor to them, more
hath come to me that pertaineth not to the schools.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>From whence, then, is thy learning?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In worldly wisdom, science, and the Jewish law, I
am beholden to their teaching; but there remaineth a
higher knowledge, the inner working of which they but
feebly discern. It hath to do with the life of man, now
and hereafter, and the cultivation of his spiritual forces.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I feel a concern touching these things, and would
fain know more of life and destiny. Peradventure some
profit may come to me through thy wisdom.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I trow thou art not fully content with the teaching
of the sages! Doubtless thou art well versed in the philosophies
of Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, and Epicurus?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I boast not myself of a deep understanding of their
doctrines; but at seasons when my sports have become
wearisome, I have felt some inner craving which I have
sought to satisfy with their wisdom. But I confess to
thee that they have not fully ministered to my need.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Wherein lieth thy discontent, O my lord Marcius?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In my earlier years I counted myself an Epicurean;
but it hath become manifest that the doctrine of Epicurus
hath lost its purity in the lives and doings of its professed
disciples. But I am persuaded that it hath error
from the beginning. Aforetime an experience in the
<foreign rend="italic">adytum</foreign> of the Temple at Tarsus showed me that death
doth not end all, as hath been taught. Since then I
have earnestly desired the full truth.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou speakest wisely. The Epicurean philosophy
contained some measure of truth, but the disbelief of life
after the grave is a deadly error.</q>
</p>

<pb n="318"/><anchor id="Pg318"/>

<p>
<q>Of that I am truly convinced. But what dost thou
think of pleasure? Epicurus taught that it was the chief
end of life, but that it could only be attained through a
rational and prudent wisdom.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In other words, that excesses defeated the very thing
sought!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, verily; but his followers have put this out of
mind.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Pleasure that cometh from righteousness is well, but
that which seemeth to come from slavery to the lower
self, in due time bringeth forth a harvest of self-destruction!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have had manifold witness of what thou sayest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But there is a pleasure that endureth which cometh
from conformity to the higher law. Behold the spirit of
that law may be summed up in love to all men.</q>
</p>

<p>
Leander took no interest in the converse, and pleading
some excuse, retired to the cabin below, where he
could read poetry or recite tragedy in his own dramatic
manner undisturbed. But Marcius, having an innate
fondness for philosophical and metaphysical speculations,
was greatly interested.
</p>

<p>
Amabel withdrew for rest to an apartment which had
been specially assigned to her; and as the Nereid sped
on towards Tarsus, Marcius, Vivian, and Serenus continued
their familiar conversation.
</p>

<p>
<q>What thinkest thou, O Serenus! of the seeming voice
which turned me from the Cydnus to the sea? As it
hath come to pass, had I not heeded it, every soul on
the Salapiæ would have gone down with her. Was it a
whisper of one of the gods?</q>
</p>

<pb n="319"/><anchor id="Pg319"/>

<p>
<q>The answer to thy question hath within it that which
to all peoples and religions is a great mystery. But the
strangeness hath only been in their perception. Peradventure
it may seem an offence unto thy religion if I
speak freely unto thee.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay, I am pleased to listen; for I perceive that thou
hast regard to the truth, as thou believest, without prejudice.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I also perceive that thou, Lord Marcius, art a Roman
of honor and fairness of judgment. But to thy question.
Be not surprised when I assure thee that there is but one
God, and not gods many!</q>
</p>

<p>
Marcius was momentarily impatient. There was a
sternness in his large black eyes which boded controversy
and disagreement. But bethinking himself of the respect
due his guest, and of his own earnest request for
an answer, he quietly observed,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Pardon me; but I was minded from Vivian’s testimony
concerning thy broad philosophy, that thou didst
no longer devote thyself to the leanness of the single
tribal god of thy people. Behold how much more free
and abundant is homage to all the gods!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou sayest well that the Hebrew ideal of God is
narrow, mean, and selfish! He is not great enough to
regard any but themselves! With all their sincerity, they
worship a false god. But the gods of the Greeks and
Romans are also false. They have the same passions,
weaknesses, and changeableness that belong to men; they
are but magnified images of their worshippers!</q>
</p>

<p>
Marcius was so struck by the truth of the statement
that he uttered no protest, and Serenus continued,—
</p>

<pb n="320"/><anchor id="Pg320"/>

<p>
<q>The one true God is supreme over all. Through his
perfect economy he ordereth all nations and tribes, yea,
and everything seen and unseen. He loveth all, for he
is Love. He is the eternal and omnipresent Spirit, who
hath no local habitation, for he filleth all space. In him
we have our breath and life, for he is the source of all
being. We, being his children, and made in his image,
are spirits, as he is Spirit, even while wearing fleshly
garments.</q>
</p>

<p>
Marcius was silent, and listened with rapt attention.
</p>

<p>
<q>The Father of all things hath everything orderly in
his dealings with the world and the children of men. He
hath from the beginning ordained powers and laws which
are unchangeably perfect in their operation; and man, by
acquainting himself with their methods and beneficent
regularity, may command their ministry. Through an
understanding of them he may even grow to be Godlike.
Behold, man reckoneth himself to be a creature of the
dust and of short duration; and by an inner law which
he knoweth not of he hath completely filled the measure
of his thought. It is an unchangeable, divine behest,
that man grows into the likeness of what he believes he
<hi rend="italic">is</hi>. Behold, the Greeks and Romans desire good in their
worship, but in their craving to discern God,—the Unseen,—they
have, in low degree, personified his laws and
forces to their hurt. Hence many gods of many names!
They have mistakenly tried to bring God down to their
level, instead of lifting their thought towards him—the
Perfect and Unchangeable. This is because their minds
are fixed wholly upon the things that are seen, and therefore
they count their bodies to be themselves.</q>
</p>

<pb n="321"/><anchor id="Pg321"/>

<p>
Marcius was visibly moved.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou hast faithfully drawn my likeness. I had always
believed that the body, or rather the head, which
is a part of it, did the thinking, until the vision of Alethea.
Then I perceived that thinking was possible
without a seen body. I was beholden to believe what I
saw, but knew not how it could be.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of a verity, it is the real self that thinks and knows;
the body being only its instrument of manifestation. Can
a harp play of itself, without a harper?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thine interpretation is good! And now, as thou hast
set forth the gods of the Greeks and Romans, tell me
more fully of the God of the Hebrews. Surely they
worship not such an one as thou hast commended?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The Hebrew is right in his belief of One; but his
small and selfish ideal concerning him hath brought forth
the natural fruit of uncharitableness, pride, and hollow
ceremony. But I unlovingly condemn neither Roman,
Greek, nor Jew. Things that are imperfect satisfy not,
and therefore finally work out that which is higher.
Because men believe their inner nature to be of the seen
instead of spiritual, they become carnal in the dim light
of such a standpoint, which is fixed among outward and
deceptive appearances. The knowledge of their inner
being, and that they are the offspring of, and one with,
the Spirit, which is All in All, is not theirs, because they
look downward. But all the children of men are slowly
feeling their way towards God; and through the teaching
of manifold tribulations will finally behold the Father’s
goodness, which will draw all to him. Could they be
persuaded that they are spirits now, no longer mistaking
<pb n="322"/><anchor id="Pg322"/>their bodies for themselves, like the lilies, they would
grow naturally towards beauty and perfection. Love
would drive out hatred, and inner spiritual harmony replace
the prevailing lower consciousness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By Pallas,—pardon the force of habit,—thy philosophy
is both reasonable and well-pleasing! Behold, while
it is new to mine ears, something within—peradventure
the voice of the morning—seems almost to testify to its
truth. But thou hast not yet interpreted the utterance
which led me to turn from the Cydnus to the sea. It
seemeth marvellous that, while it guided me, I felt that
I freely chose the cruise.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That which I have spoken may help in the understanding
of the voice. The mind of man is so subtly
wrought that it hath many hidden forces which commonly
remain latent, and of the usefulness of which men
are ignorant. We may be likened to children with playthings
in their hands, in which are wrapped up signs and
wonders. The dominion of soul or mind extendeth to
the ends of the earth, and is in no wise limited to the
bodily members. The Universal Spirit, though not regarded
in man’s thoughts, often speaketh to his inner
nature. Like uttereth itself to like, and spirit to spirit.
Of a verity, it never ceaseth its whisperings to every
inner ear that is open. But few there be that listen.
Peradventure in some way thou art being prepared to
be a listener. I am persuaded, therefore, that this day,
before the third hour, thou didst have a touch, in thine
inmost soul, of the peril of the Salapiæ, and a prompting
of thy free will to come to her relief. That which seemeth
a mystery may be childlike and plain when its
<pb n="323"/><anchor id="Pg323"/>orderly working is made known. Thou mightest also
have been moved—like as by a flash—by the outgoing
of our own thought, which is a divine operation put into
our own hands for ministry and service to one another.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then thou dost not count the voice as marvellous?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Peradventure a miracle to thee, because it seemeth
strange in thine eyes; but no more wonderful in itself
than that the goodly Nereid is wafted along by the air
of heaven.</q>
</p>

<p>
The theologies of all the ages have uniformly held in
disregard that which has been termed <q>naturalism.</q>
But it seems pertinent to inquire where its boundary
lines can be drawn, and, in fact, if it does not include
everything, both material and spiritual. If these terms
were employed simply to designate an orderly lower and
higher in the established economy, as they sometimes
are, their usefulness would be obvious. But they have
been set in antithesis, one seeming to imply the divine
and orderly course of all sequence, and the other that
economy broken into or superseded. Can the perfect
and unchangeable God contradict himself? Is the spiritual
realm less amenable to uniform method in the
relation of cause and effect than its external and material
counterpart?
</p>

<p>
Just in proportion that the normality of the summits
of moral and spiritual attainment is presented, they are
made attractive to the human mind and consciousness.
In the very nature of things, <q>supernaturalism,</q> which
savors of the unnatural and abnormal, fails to commend
itself to the highest reason. In some degree it is repellent.
As human ignorance, superstition, and irrational
<pb n="324"/><anchor id="Pg324"/>assumption are left behind, the hearts of men go out
after an orderly Deity. They turn towards him as naturally
as flowers open themselves to the sun. The book
of nature contains a symmetrical revelation of God, and
there is nothing common nor unclean. There is no
<q>secular,</q> for all is sacred. Everything has been consecrated
without the intervention of the puny rites of man.
</p>

<p>
A lawful chain of sequences is as surely found in the
soul as in chemistry or physics. When the orderly
beauty of individual spiritual unfoldment is seen by man,
be he high or low, ignorant or learned, bond or free,
black or white, Roman or Greek, pagan or Christian, his
heart throbs, and his desire warms towards the upward
path which opens before him.
</p>

<p>
The announcement came up from below that refreshments
were served, and Marcius gracefully escorted his
guests to the faultless repast. In the beauty of every
detail, the triclinium of the house of a Roman senator
could hardly have excelled the private dining-apartment
of the Nereid. With artistic gracefulness flowers and
perfumes were mingled with dainty viands. The highly
polished floor, which was tinted with minium, exhaled a
delicate, rose-like odor. Four serving-boys, in white robes
of bissus, entered while the guests were standing, and
placed upon each corner of the table a small tutelary
statue, or Lar, and after all were reclining, reverently
raised an amphora of wine above their heads, exclaiming
in concert, <q>May the gods favor us!</q> Marcius
seemed unconscious of any ostentation, nothing being
unusual. His guests were quite at ease. Choice old
Falernian and other wines were offered, but declined,
<pb n="325"/><anchor id="Pg325"/>and with the true instinct of a host, Marcius partook
very sparingly of them himself.
</p>

<p>
The conversation turned upon the recent storm, the
experiences of the Salapiæ, Tarsian life, the latest news
from Rome, and other current topics.
</p>

<p>
When the meal was ended they again ascended to the
upper deck. With every stitch of canvas drawing the
fresh breeze, and every spar bending gracefully with
the pressure, the Nereid skimmed rapidly over the waves,
and erelong the separate towers and roofs of Tarsus began
to resolve themselves out of the broadening gray-and-white
mass. The white sails of the ships of many
nations also dotted the harbor in the distance.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the little group were again seated, Marcius
expressed his desire to know yet more fully of the opinions
and doctrines of Serenus.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thy philosophy seemeth so reasonable and pleasing
that I would fain listen to thee further. The worship of
Jupiter, Hercules, and all the gods of Rome and Tarsus
hath not given me full satisfaction, and their former
purity hath become degenerated. But I would have
none of the Hebrew austerity and stiff ceremonialism.
I have beheld their gall-and-wormwood faces in Tarsus,
and their sackcloth and ashes, self-conceit and ugly circumcision,
disgust me. But thou art no Hebrew! If
thou wert born to them, thou art not of them, for thou
beholdest good in all men.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I perceive that of a verity thou dost desire the
truth,</q> replied Serenus. <q>Whosoever seeketh it for its
own sake will come more and more into its light, and
wax strong in its strength. Nothing less can break the
<pb n="326"/><anchor id="Pg326"/>shackles of superstition and bigotry, whether of Hebrew,
Greek, or Roman fashioning, and set men free. Only
he who seeth some good—yea, some Godlikeness—in
all hath his eyes open to behold the oneness and allness
of Truth, which includeth concord and love, and which is
yet to be the great religion of the children of men. The
self-sufficient and vain-glorious devotees of the many
cults and theologies each believe themselves alone to be
righteous; for their outward gaze is fastened upon the
most evil and unreal aspects of all systems besides their
own.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thinkest thou that I have misjudged the Hebrew?
Behold I have seen those things of which I have spoken
in the very streets of Tarsus.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I doubt not the outward appearances which thou hast
witnessed; but even in those hollow and ostentatious
ceremonials there may be an inner good intent. All
men are blindly feeling after God,—the chief Good; but
they often lose themselves in the by-paths of external
authority and unreasoning belief. Men have the utterance
of the Spirit of Truth in their inmost being, but
they fail to interpret its drawing, because they are listening
to a confused chorus of voices outside. Behold
the divine law, or the perfect guide, for the thought and
conduct of men hath not been fully set forth by seers
and philosophers, inscribed in creeds or voiced by oracles,
neither hath the Israelitish Decalogue, which was engraven
upon tables of stone, entirely contained it. But
in man’s being, or real nature, it is written in living characters,—letters
of fire.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Then if one be wayward and disobedient, he
offend<pb n="327"/><anchor id="Pg327"/>eth not so much external codes, as the laws and principles
of his own constitution.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou couldst not have declared the truth more perfectly!
There is a divine image, or Son of God, in man.
He may be known as the Anointed One, or Christ,
within. But commonly he remaineth unmanifested.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By Hercules!—pass over the custom,—that seemeth
to be a hard saying. Sayest thou that the ignorant, the
base, and all men have this Anointed One, the Son,
hidden within the depths of their being?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea; it is the very corner-stone of their nature, though
they know it not. They think and feel that all men—themselves
included—are corrupt in their being,
because the troubled waves upon the surface of their
every-day consciousness are evil and rebellious. Therefore
they yield themselves to the dominion of appearances,
and become slaves to the seen, and to those things
which their own thoughts have created, and their own
sensuous faculties upreared.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O wise young Hebrew!—nay, more than Hebrew!
thy philosophy, as thou settest it forth, carrieth conviction,
and seemeth worthy of confidence. It satisfieth
my questionings far more perfectly than anything I have
found in Greek or Roman lore. But I fain would know
if any one among all the sons of men hath fully brought
the Son, the Anointed One—or Christ, as thou hast
called him—into real and perfect outward manifestation?
Behold is not this the great need in order that
men may have their inmost quality made visible? Thinkest
thou that such an Inner made Outer will ever appear
among the children of men?</q>
</p>

<pb n="328"/><anchor id="Pg328"/>

<p>
<q><hi rend="smallcaps">He hath appeared already!</hi></q>
</p>

<p>
The intense interest which had made Marcius almost
oblivious to their rapid progress seemed to reach a climax.
His strong, dark features lighted up with an unwonted
curiosity; but at that moment there was a commotion
around them, for they had arrived at the landing where
they were to disembark.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold thy converse hath touched my very heart,
and I pray thee that I may hear further of this matter.
Do thou and thy wife purpose to abide in Tarsus?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Peradventure for a season, though we have set our
faces towards Rome.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I bid you welcome to my palace. Mine is thine.
Pray abide under my roof during your sojourn.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou dost honor us with great kindness; but we are
wonted to little pomp, and thy hospitality seemeth too
generous.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou dost deserve honor for thy great goodness and
learning; but if thou dost so desire, thy abiding-place
shall, withal, be humble, and thou shalt be free from
obligation.</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus accepted the hearty invitation, and with Amabel
prepared to leave the Nereid and become guests
of Marcius. Vivian also was warmly welcomed to the
special friendship of the Vice Legate, and was assured
of the pleasure which his visits to the palace would
afford.
</p>

<p>
By the order of Marcius the rescued sailors of the Salapiæ
were to be abundantly ministered unto so long as
their necessities remained.
</p>

<p>
Leander, while outwardly gracious to the new-found
<pb n="329"/><anchor id="Pg329"/>friends of Marcius, could hardly conceal his jealousy
towards them; for their converse had disquieted him,
and his own society and games had been superseded.
</p>

<p>
The state carriage, or chariot, of Marcius, with three
gayly caparisoned horses of choice breed, harnessed
abreast, was awaiting him when the Nereid landed; and
soon the Vice Legate, with his friends, including Leander,
were rolling rapidly over the well-worn flags towards
the palace. The luxurious equipage, with the richly
adorned charioteer and footmen, the clatter of the hoofs
of the noble steeds, and the musical jingle of silver chain
traces, drew the attention of every one in the streets
while they passed by. As they dashed rapidly through
the business quarter, a young woman, seemingly a Jewess,
no longer in the early flush of youth, but of remarkable
beauty, was just emerging from one of the bazaars, where
she had been to make some trifling purchases.
</p>

<p>
It was Rebecca!
</p>

<p>
Casting an involuntary glance upwards, the face of
Marcius—that face forever carved upon the tablet of
memory—was directly before her. A quick shiver shot
through her frame, but in the twinkling of an eye her
glance took in another face just behind. Barely suppressing
the impulse to speak aloud, she exclaimed to
herself,—
</p>

<p>
<q>My friend of the Holy City! and with <hi rend="smallcaps">that Roman</hi>!</q>

<p>
Every incident of the journey to the Holy City was
fresh and vivid to Saulus, and he felt persuaded that it
was no dream. Amoz observed his quick uprising,
which astonished him, because but a short time had
passed since he had been soothed and quieted after his
wonted evening plaint.
</p>

<p>
The next day Saulus wrote the following letter:—

<p>
<q rend="post: none">O my dear Cassia!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Things have befallen me which will seem strange to
thee! I have been led by the God which is above all
gods, who speaketh to me from the stillness within, into
a new and higher way that I knew not. Behold thou
wilt have exceeding contempt for me when thou knowest
that I have become a follower of the Nazarene, and am
filled with great sorrow at my former persecution of his
followers. I have deep repentance for my manifold unrighteous
deeds, even though I thought to do service to
the God of Israel. Through a leading that I would not
resist I have journeyed into the wilderness, away from
the habitations of men, that I might commune with a
<pb n="331"/><anchor id="Pg331"/>Greater than the God known by our nation, and receive
inspiration from him. Here I am patiently adding
strength to strength, that in the fulness of time I may
go forth to proclaim liberty to all who are bound,
whether through subjection to the flesh, or under the
galling yoke of the ceremonial law. I feel a renewing
in my mind, and have an unwonted joy in the freedom
and purity of the New Faith. Behold it satisfieth every
desire of the heart, and cometh as a healing balm to my
former restless hatred and false righteousness. I delight
in the true God, for he is over all men,—Abiding
Love,—and no longer the jealous leader of one people.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">O Cassia, well beloved! my soul’s earnest longing
is that thou also might have regard to this truth, for its
value is above rubies! Wilt thou not open thy heart to
its sweet spirit? My love waxeth strong towards thee,
but I am constrained to make known everything concerning
myself. Thou freely gavest me the love of thy heart
and thy steadfast promise of faithfulness, but perchance
thou wilt not regard me as the same Saulus that possessed
thy warm affection. But with all humility I am
persuaded that my present state is not to be compared

yea, and fiery persecutions, which are among
the base things that I forever have put behind me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">In the place of hatred for all but the straitest sect
of the Chosen People, I now exercise love towards all
men. Dost thou not see, O my Cassia! that we were
altogether fettered in our doctrine; for a Godly religion
aboundeth in peace, joy, and good-will. If thy soul yet
yearneth with affection towards thy lover, I pray thee
<pb n="332"/><anchor id="Pg332"/>that it may go out even more strongly in the favor of this
great and living Faith!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Behold we were altogether mistaken about the evil
intent of the followers of the Nazarene! Through false

they have a ministry of goodly service and longsuffering.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">It is meet that I should write unto thee, O my little
Cassia! with mine own hand, to give assurance that my
soul’s affection for thee abideth single and true. I pray
thee that thou consider well that the new and all-abounding
joy that I have in the New Faith hath not rendered
me unfaithful. But I can in no wise abate one jot or
tittle of my devotion to a great future work,—to bring all
men, so far as I am able, to a knowledge of the truth.
This new and higher way was made manifest for all the
world through the despised prophet of Nazareth, whose
disciples I have so grievously smitten and afflicted aforetime.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">To thee, O Cassia! I remain with all constancy, if
thy heart’s affection still aboundeth to me-ward, not
the same self-willed zealot thou hast known, but the
devoted Apostle of the Most High, and the earnest
minister of the New Faith to all men. But with my
love in no wise abated towards thee, nothing on earth,
not even the utter loss of thy devotion, can in the
least tempt me to turn back to my former manner of
mind. If thou hast no desire to receive the new Saulus
in the place of him whom thou hast known, behold I
freely give thee release from all thy plighted faith, so
that thou mayest be fully free.</q>

<p>
On the same day that the above was written, Saulus
wrote the following to Rebecca, who was now in her
Tarsian home. Both letters were despatched by Amoz
to the station where they would be taken by a passing
caravan.
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">O my dear Rebecca!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">I would fain pour out my heart unto thee! Behold,
my beloved sister, thou wilt have unwonted astonishment
when this epistle reacheth thine hand, to know that thy
hard-hearted but now contrite brother dwelleth in a cave
in the land of Arabia. But thou wilt marvel yet more
greatly, when I declare unto thee that I am a disciple
of the New Faith. I, Saulus! so long exceeding mad
against those of that Way, am a miracle unto myself!
I well nigh feel my soul to be twain in one body,—the
Old and the New; but I live and move, now and
henceforth, in the New.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">It is meet that thou, my sister, companion and
guar<pb n="334"/><anchor id="Pg334"/>dian of my tender years, shouldst now receive some
acknowledgment of the abundance of thy gentle goodness
and great patience to me-ward throughout my whole
unrighteous course of life. While I persuaded myself
through deceitful belief that I was faithful to the Chosen
People, and even doing God service in my threatenings
and slaughter among the saints of God, there was a Spirit
giving utterance deep within my soul which never ceased
to rebuke me. But I was stiff-necked, and would not listen
to that Voice, which I now know to have been the
judgment of the Most High. The Eternal Spirit was
prone to touch my spirit, but in my blindness I would
have none of it. In due season that inner reverberation
became like the sound of thunder! I vainly strove to stop
my ears and to drown its persuasion by scrupulous ceremonial
service, and withal by persecuting all who were
not of the straitest sect of the household of Israel.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">But why set before thee afresh those things which thou
knowest too well, and which must needs only provoke my
shame. From this day I leave them behind, and hold
them no more in remembrance. Thou didst ever strive
to guide my feet in the higher way, but in my pride and
vainglory I despised thy counsel! Of all who abode in
the house at the Sheepmarket, thou only didst discern
some reflection of truth in the lives of the followers of
the manifested Light!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Honor to Serenus! I was hardened against that pure
wisdom in him which thou didst so clearly perceive!
Perfect contentment can never again possess me until I
behold him face to face, yea, and sit at his feet, and learn
more of that Spirit of Truth which so clearly shone
<pb n="335"/><anchor id="Pg335"/>through him, after the pattern of the Nazarene. The
remembrance of his unfailing virtue will remain with me
and yield inspiration. Hast thou any knowledge of his
place of sojourn since I banished him from the Holy
City? Moreover, hast thou heard any tidings from Amabel,
the daughter of the Rabban, who departed from her
father’s house, yea, and the Holy City also, for the sake
of the New Faith?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Regarding my own present state, I am persuaded that
I have some beginnings of that Spirit which filled Jesus
of Nazareth. I patiently wait that I may learn more of
his life from those who were outwardly taught of him.</q>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">The solitude of the wilderness, the joy of the Unseen
Presence, and rest from the turmoil of the world and the
differences of men, are my meat and drink. In due time
they will heal the wounds of my repentant soul, and be
manifested in new strength of body, howbeit a weakness
yet remaineth with me. Peradventure it is a messenger
to rebuke any spiritual pride that may beset me, and also
that through its overcoming I may wax stronger in the
inner man.</q>

<p>
The days that followed passed serenely with the two
inmates of the cave. Saulus steadily gained in strength
of body, and his vigor of soul also increased day by day.
Often during the morning hours, with Amoz and the
camel, he made short journeys in the adjacent region,
generally returning by the sixth hour of the day to their
wonted solitude.
</p>

<p>
Amoz felt a growing concern touching the experiences
and plans of Saulus, whom he learned to love with a
deep devotion, and to whose teaching he listened with
gladness and profit. One evening an unwonted long
silence succeeded the period of Saulus’s weakness, and
Amoz was moved to inquire concerning the nature of his
self-communing.
</p>

<pb n="337"/><anchor id="Pg337"/>

<p>
<q>O my dear friend and teacher, I would know the
secret of thy meditations! Behold, when thou art silent
with thine eyes closed, thy face almost seemeth to shine
with joy! Tell me of thy thoughts! When I fain would
rest my mind, it is full of troubled waves, and I find no
peace.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thy inquiry concerneth a great truth to which the
eyes of the world are yet holden. It hath been made
known to me through the working of my great tribulation.
A little while aforetime my former bitterness and
persecutions stood out before my soul by day and night.
The thoughts of my innumerable transgressions scourged
me without measure, and I knew of no escape. Vainly I
strove to put them to flight, but their hellish faces of reproach
gathered thick, and stared at me in season and
out of season. Wherever I turned, my tormentors followed,
and my soul was affrighted. But a new and
higher way hath been revealed unto me. I fasten my
meditation upon God,—the Omnipresent Good,—and
upon everything that is true and beautiful and of good
report, and behold the former things flee because they
have no place!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold that is a path to freedom that I have not understood!
My former life hath not been given to persecutions,
but even those things that appear much smaller
greatly disquiet me. Slumber forsaketh mine eyelids by
reason of many things that seem against me. My soul
is filled with manifold fears that have taken up their
habitation in me and will not be removed. But thou
hast given me much light, and filled me with hope. I
thought it wise to hide these things from thee, but now
<pb n="338"/><anchor id="Pg338"/>rejoice that I have invited thy counsel. I will fasten
my thoughts upon the Good and not the evil. But the
way seemeth not easy, for the strong who possess a fortress
will not be put out except by a stronger.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou judgest rightly. It is not a light thing, but
patience will accomplish her perfect work and in due
season be rewarded. Because all things rest in the
bosom of God, Good is stronger than all else, yea, it
is all! Behold we ignorantly magnify evil by our mistaken
thoughts until it covereth everything! To the
pure eye and the right thought adverse appearances become
friendly. All things were created good, but man
formeth them anew for himself by his thought. God is
too pure to behold iniquity, because only he who hath in
himself some measure of evil hath the perverted vision
to recognize it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold, O Saulus! thy wisdom leadeth into the light,
and thou hast planted my feet upon a rock! I bless the
day upon which I turned my steps into the wilderness
with thee! By thy interpretation it well nigh appeareth
that every man, through his own thoughts, shapeth to
himself the whole world in which he dwelleth!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou speakest a hidden truth, which in the fulness
of time will become plain, and thereby the kingdom of
Heaven will be set up in all the earth! The world
groaneth and travaileth through the fear of things that it
hath recreated through its own vain imagining. As to
unseemly fears, they abide not only with thee, but with
all men. Because our fathers have feared God instead
of loving and seeking him, they have filled the earth
with trembling and weakness. Fear hath torment, and
<pb n="339"/><anchor id="Pg339"/>bringeth forth an all-prevailing harvest of pain and sorrow,
and also sickness of mind and body! Our fathers
at this very mountain did quake and tremble because
they thought God, like a fretful man, was angry, and
therefore sent a tempest of thunderings and lightnings.
To give our souls to the dominion of things that are
seen also bringeth us into subjection to evil. They are
but outward appearances, while unseen verities abide
forever.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I give judgment that thou hast learned all these
things since thy departure from the Holy City?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou thinkest rightly! They came not from the
traditions of men, nor the teaching of schools, but are
revealed only from within!</q>
</p>

<p>
The next day Amoz made a visit to the halting-place
of the caravans, and upon his return handed a sealed
package to Saulus. It was a letter from Cassia, and
ran as follows:—
</p>

<p>
The visage of Saulus as he read the missive to the
end was pale but placid. Not a word escaped his lips,
but with careful deliberation he slowly tore the delicate
parchment into small pieces, and scattered them in one
of the deep chasms of the cave.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
Often during a stormy evening, when the elements
seem chaotic, and the gusty night wind sweeps the
broken clouds or dark mist rapidly along, a brilliant
star will burst into full view for a moment, and then
disappear.
</p>

<p>
So down through the kaleidoscopic procession of
the ages, at intervals some great soul shines out in
full-orbed strength and beauty. The light of history
reveals that these are they who have passed through
tribulation.
</p>

<p>
The diamonds and other precious jewels owe their
beauty to the intense fusing to which they have been
subjected in the Plutonic blasts and glowing flames
of Nature’s laboratory. The cruder natural settings in
<pb n="342"/><anchor id="Pg342"/>which they are clasped are baser, because they have
never found their way into her crucible.
</p>

<p>
As the rough block of marble is chipped, broken, and
seemingly almost destroyed before the imprisoned form
of beauty can be set free, so the trip-hammers of Fate,
whose terrible blows well nigh crush out the very life
of their victim, by a strange paradox finally render
him shapely beyond compare. The towering spirits that
have worn material embodiment are those whose earthy
cords, deemed so vital by the world, have, one by one,
been snapped, until they found their life by losing it.
</p>

<p>
Saulus, the son of Benoni, was a casting from the furnace
of such an order of development. Even the persecutions
which had been waged by him doubtless had a
place among the lurid flaming tongues which, in a white
heat, contributed to the shaping of the new Saulus.
</p>

<p>
Cassia’s letter severed the last subtle cord which tethered
him to the earthly. He was emancipated. Not, be
it understood, that celibacy, asceticism, or other-worldliness
are normal, or worthy to be sought, but that in
the moral and spiritual economy of humanity, there <hi rend="italic">are</hi>
souls whose rounding and polishing come only through
infinite travail.
</p>

<p>
But if the white flower of truth and spiritual attainment
seem to blossom most perfectly when its roots
have struck deep in the slimiest moral soil, let it not be
forgotten that the viscous mass is not the cause, but
only the occasion, of its supernal beauty. The divine
germ hath all potency within itself; but it becometh
expedient that it be plunged into low conditions, until
through the exercise of lifting itself therefrom, it not
<pb n="343"/><anchor id="Pg343"/>only nourishes its own strength, but finally transforms
its base environment.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of the day upon which Cassia’s letter
had been received, the two friends felt an unwonted
nearness and soul-contact. Saulus had said nothing
of the contents of the message, but Amoz divined the
whole matter as fully as if he had read it word for word.
Though not greatly skilled in the learning of the schools,
there was in him a simple spiritual sensitiveness which
made everything plain. His life with Saulus had brought
them into close touch, and he measurably reflected his
leader’s experiences, and there was oneness in heart and
interest.
</p>

<p>
Saulus was not cast down by Cassia’s unequivocal decision,
but instead there came a consciousness of freedom
and spiritual growth. A soul-burden had been lifted.
His great regard for Cassia would in no wise be lost,
but the special love which had possessed him was transformed
into simple compassion. Barred as he was from
any possibility of leading her into the light himself, she
must wait for the slower education of event and experience.
</p>

<p>
The evening being cool, the two mused before a small
fire, for the service of which the spacious cave afforded
ample opportunity. The hour grew late, and they long
had been sitting side by side, no word being spoken.
Perfect harmony prevailed with a stillness that seemed
mystical.
</p>

<p>
At length Amoz opened his lips, but his voice had a
strange sound. Saulus turned and looked into his face.
His eyes were closed, but not with sleep. There was a
<pb n="344"/><anchor id="Pg344"/>calm, sweet expression upon his countenance, but it was
unfamiliar—plainly not that of Amoz. A slight tremor
shook his frame, but only for a moment.
</p>

<p>
But harken! what saith the voice?
</p>

<p>
<q>Saulus, behold thou art my beloved brother!</q>
</p>

<p>
Saulus drew nearer, and warmly grasped the open hand
which was extended towards him. While filled with wonder,
there was nothing to disquiet him. He saw at a
glance that some other soul possessed the body of his
companion.
</p>

<p>
<q>The words of thy greeting are warm, and touch my
heart, but I would know thy name, and why thou hast
come to me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am Stephanos! aforetime of the Holy City. I
come to manifest my love, and give thee words of encouragement!</q>
</p>

<p>
There flashed before the mind of Saulus the Holy
City! the mob in the synagogue! the throng, which
with jeers and curses, surged up the hill to the Sanhedrin!
the mockery of the trial in the Hall of the Squares!
the heroic young victim! the boiling passion! the tragedy
without the walls! the angelic face! and—his own
leadership!
</p>

<p>
<q>O my God! I cannot bear it!</q>
</p>

<p>
He bowed his face to the ground.
</p>

<p>
<q>Be of good cheer, O Saulus! I greet thee only with
love!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O Stephanos! thou here! and thou lovest me! Am
I not dreaming? Canst thou forgive?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am here, and it is no delusive dream! From the
beginning thou hast been forgiven, and my love abideth
<pb n="345"/><anchor id="Pg345"/>with thee! Forget all that is behind, and press forward,
for behold great things wait for thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
Continuing the warm clasp of hands, they sat down,
face to face.
</p>

<p>
<q>And thou art Stephanos! what joyful tidings! For
a season my guilty soul had rest neither day nor night.
But now thou hast confirmed the peace which hath been
growing in me since my sojourn in the wilderness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have knowledge of thy good estate. Behold thy
soul will become mighty, and thou will open the eyes
of much people! I am but one of an unseen cloud of
witnesses who will give thee strength and inspiration!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am but newly born of the Spirit, and have much
to learn. I fain would know how thou art employed, and
how thou dost come to me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold they, who while in the fleshly body ministered
to the needs of their brethren, continue their ministry
unbroken by the change of condition. There are
manifold ways in which we of the Unseen move upon the
minds of men which language would fail to express, and
which thou couldst not now fully understand. Love
lendeth us wings, and so far as the souls of men are
open to the entrance of the truth, we are able to reflect
some light to them. But the multitude are ignorantly
closed! They count themselves to be fleshly in being,
therefore the things of the Spirit are hidden from their
eyes. They believe not in ministering spirits, neither
care they for any understanding of the things of the
higher life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do all who have passed thither engage in the ministry
of love and good-will?</q>
</p>

<pb n="346"/><anchor id="Pg346"/>

<p>
<q>Nay! There is a great throng whom no man can
number who have laid off the flesh, but who are yet
entangled in the meshes of the fleshly mind! They are
spirits who are in prison, and the loving guidance of the
free spirits have much exercise in their release.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hast thou a body and members when thou dost not
possess the form of Amoz through which thou speakest
to me?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, verily! Our bodies, though lighter than air, as
known to you, are vastly more substantial than the seen
shadows which men count as themselves. It is only
the invisible which has real being! The seen man is
but an incidental manifestation of <hi rend="small">MAN</hi>!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I behold the beauty and truth of thy wisdom! Wilt
thou not teach me further?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There are even more refined bodies than ours!
When that which is perfect is come, behold we shall
have laid off these for those that are still more internal
and subtle! The path from glory to glory towards the
perfect Love is ever away from the grosser in every
degree. But that which is gross hath its place; for the
seed of the divine life must needs have an early planting
in coarse soil, that through the exercise of its growth
back towards the Father’s House it may consciously recognize
its quality, and interpret its real nature!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is the other life very near to this?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is but one life, but it hath many expressions.
While in the flesh, the quality of thought and mind of
each is closely veiled from others, but here the intent of
the heart is openly manifest! The inner character standeth
out, fully rounded, and none can mistake it! But in
<pb n="347"/><anchor id="Pg347"/>due time knowledge increaseth, and those who are lower
are taught and inspired through the guidance of some
who already have attained to greater power and glory.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It seemeth that all things work together for good.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou judgest rightly! We live in Spirit; for God is
Spirit, and we have his image, whether in the flesh or
out of it! But to live in the flesh is not to live of it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am much beholden to thee, for thou hast made
many mysteries plain. And now hast thou any instructions
which thou wouldst have me follow?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay. Take no man for authority, whether he be
dwelling in the seen or the unseen! Men may aid and
cheer and teach thee, but determination cometh from thy
free will when illumined by the inner Word. Follow the
divine leading within thee, and thou shalt have true freedom!
Behold the Anointed Leader—the Christ—must
be uncovered in every soul! My spoken words are at
an end. Peace and joy abide with thee, and to Amoz
blessing and good-will. Thanks be to him for the service
which he hath rendered us.</q>
</p>

<p>
A mild sweet fragrance and light filled the cave, but
soon all was as before.

<head>CHAPTER XXVIII<lb/>LEANDER VISITS A MYSTIC SHRINE</head>

<p>
Rebecca made her way homeward in a state of profound
bewilderment. By nature placid, intuitive, and
rarely disturbed, her sweet soul, as a rule, moved with
serenity amid the turmoil of life’s experiences and adversities.
</p>

<p>
But could it be that the noble Serenus was the guest
of that Roman of tarnished memory? Could light and
darkness commingle? It seemed a strange paradox.
</p>

<p>
Having not long since returned from the Holy City,
she was not aware of the great change which had taken
place in the character back of that stern face, nor that it
now belonged to the Vice Legate of Tarsus.
</p>

<p>
Since the rescue of Rebecca from the stampede at the
great celebration of the Feast of Weeks in Jerusalem, and
the conversation with her benefactor, Serenus, to her,
had stood for everything that was worthy and of good
report. She also remembered his lofty and quiet dignity
as he headed the notable line of captives upon whom she
looked down from the house-top when they were led to
prison by Saulus. The devotion of Serenus to the New
Faith, and the cheerfulness with which he endured persecution
for its sake, had left a picture upon her mind that
could never be effaced.
</p>

<pb n="349"/><anchor id="Pg349"/>

<p>
Her wonder increased when she thought not only of
the apparent intimacy between the two, but also at the
possible position of Marcius, as indicated by the imperial
equipment. But her wonted serenity was soon regained.
She instinctively felt the power of goodness,
and that however it might be explained, Serenus, in the
very nature of the case, must carry a powerful benediction
wherever he went.
</p>

<p>
She also had noticed Amabel, and although not recognizing
her as the daughter of Gamaliel, inferred that she
was the wife of Serenus. As this conviction flashed
upon her, there arose for a single moment a half unconscious
shadow of disappointment, although not admitted
even to herself.
</p>

<p>
It is not easy for the human mind to regard virtue
and nobility abstractly, or as separate from the personality
through which they are expressed. But the
calm, warm sunlight which constantly filled the soul of
Rebecca quickly dispelled any possible mist. While
she felt that the few words Serenus once had spoken
to her, and the inspiration of his presence and heroism,
in some way had introduced her to something higher
than she before had known, there was nothing which
could be interpreted as of the nature of personal love.
He only had been the instrument in stirring the strings
of her higher nature, peradventure to some invisible
vibrations of the New Faith.
</p>

<p>
Rebecca always had been an enigma to her people.
Though scrupulously reared in the observance of every
requirement of the most orthodox Judaism, from her
very youth there had been within her an unfathomable
<pb n="350"/><anchor id="Pg350"/>reserve. While conforming in every outward requirement
to that which was expected of her, there was a
calm but strong undercurrent of freedom, and a thinly
concealed indifference to formalism, which had been a
disquietude to Benoni, and an offence to Saulus. Her
sojourn in the Holy City had perceptibly developed the
essence of a new principle in her inner nature, which
before had been little more than latent. Though having
but the slightest contact with the personal exponents
of the New Faith and their outward teaching,
she instinctively had felt something of its beauty and
force. But the more it had been repressed by the influences
about her, the more it gathered volume.
</p>

<p>
There is ever an unseen moral and spiritual atmosphere
in which vibrations are constant. In it are currents
and eddies, winds and calms, heat and cold, as
truly as in the meteorological realm of nature. Sensitive
souls, like invisible barometers, feel and register
movements and tendencies which ordinarily are intangible.
The spread of pure and spiritual Christianity
during the time of the Primitive Church and immediately
succeeding was an object lesson which all ages
since might have studied with profit. It was perhaps
due more to an unseen vital momentum—a spiritual
tidal wave—than the outward teaching of disciples and
missionaries. Unweighed by dogmatism, untrammelled
by ecclesiasticism, and free from rigid formalism, it,
as a vital force, went out conquering and to conquer.
It was a new life—good news; but later to be shorn
of its spontaneity, dispossessed of its witness of the
Spirit, bereft of its healing potency for soul and body,
<pb n="351"/><anchor id="Pg351"/>and deprived of its innate joyousness through usurped
authority and burdensome accretion. Its very name
came to signify something external in the place of a
living principle.
</p>

<p>
The state chariot which conveyed the little party from
the Nereid circled through the spacious grounds which
surrounded the palace of Marcius, and all alighted at
one of the private portals. Serenus and Amabel were
conducted into one of the open courts, where they remained
until suitable apartments were made ready. A
small fountain was playing in the centre, surrounded
by flowering plants and beautiful statues.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold we have been led in a path we knew not of!</q> said
Serenus; <q>and I am persuaded that good will come of it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Upon their arrival, Leander retired to his own rooms
in a very unenviable frame of mind. For some time he
had consciously been losing his influence with Marcius,
and their ways were rapidly drifting apart. The official
duties of the Vice Legate were performed with fidelity,
and his growing nobility of character and public commendation
had given Leander an illy concealed, cynical
jealousy. But so far the fire had only smouldered.
Now he felt that in the interest and regard of Marcius
he was thoroughly supplanted. Was he, who for
so long had been the bosom friend and adviser, henceforth
to be left out of the account? There is a jealousy
not born of sex which may be fed until it grows
in intensity almost without limit.
</p>

<p>
Leander finally resolved upon an interview with his
old-time friend. He found him unoccupied, and proceeded
to unfold his grievances.
</p>

<pb n="352"/><anchor id="Pg352"/>

<p>
<q>If I may presume somewhat upon thy former friendship,
I would have private converse with thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
Marcius noted the thinly concealed suspicion and
cynicism which were stirring the pulse of Leander, but
passing them by, quietly replied,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Pray unburden thy mind!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By Pallas! I begin to distrust my power to solve a
riddle! For some time past a mystical change seems to
be coming upon thee which I am unable to fathom!
Thou hast lost thy love of pleasure, and even thy devotion
to the gods. In a word, thou art in danger of
becoming a victim of baseless superstition.</q>
</p>

<p>
Marcius was astonished at the bitterness of his words,
but retorted with quiet sarcasm,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Thy wonted poetic grace of expression seemeth to
have deserted thee! Thy speech is ungarnished, if not
ungracious! If a change hath come over me, it need be
no riddle to thee! As one adds to his years, it is meet
that he should add somewhat to his wisdom.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Shades of Pluto! Dost thou call the babbling of
fools wisdom? Thou hast waded in the shallow sophistries
of so-called philosophy until it well nigh hath made
thee an anchorite! Thou hast deserted thine old associates
and pleasures, and art becoming a dreamer. And
now, to crown thy folly, thou hast brought contempt upon
thy government and religion by making this pair of Hebrew
fanatics thine honored guests.</q>
</p>

<p>
Marcius was unruffled by the sharp thrusts, and listened
much as he would to the scolding of a petulant
child.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thy chattering doth not in the least move me! I
<pb n="353"/><anchor id="Pg353"/>can well dispense with thy advice, for of late both thy
friendliness and wisdom are becoming visibly tarnished!
Would to the gods—or God—that I had more of what
thou art pleased to regard as Hebrew fanaticism! But I
would have thee know that my guests are in no wise like
the Hebrews of Tarsus. Their philosophy is grand, wise,
beautiful, and I honor their opinions, and will know
more of their teaching. It will be but a waste of thy
breath to try to dissuade me!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And suppose it become known that the Vice Legate
of Tarsus hath forsworn the gods of the city, and set at
naught the Roman Pantheon for the worship of fugitive
and unknown gods—or a lone god, as I heard thy paragon,
Serenus, set forth in his teaching! One would
think that to a sane Roman patrician such vulgar drivel
and low-bred association would be disgusting!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Were I not amused at thine audacity, and compassionate
of thy shallow assumption, I should make comment
upon thy growls as they deserve. Thy unwonted
denunciation hath even dried the springs of poesy which
aforetime hath flown in a deluge from thy lips.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Henceforth I abide no longer under thy roof, which
is now devoted to the shelter of vulgar pretenders who
claim all wisdom. By the right arm of Hercules! thou
wilt yet rue the day when thou hast preferred the friendship
of an ass in a lion’s skin to the polish, art, and
poetry of thy Greek companion of many years!</q>
</p>

<lg>
<l>“I spread my sail, and float away</l>
<l>From a shore grown now sterile and hateful;</l>
<l>I end this play, and start to-day</l>
<l>For freedom, I care not how fateful!”</l>
</lg>

<pb n="354"/><anchor id="Pg354"/>

<p>
<q>Broken loose again! There is nothing here to compel
the presence of thy muse or thyself! I give thee farewell!</q>
</p>

<p>
Marcius offered a dignified parting salutation, which
Leander turned his back upon, and hastily left the room.
</p>

<p>
A few days afterwards there occurred one of those
religious upheavals which at intervals find vent in popular
tumult. The number of Jews in Tarsus had steadily
increased, and their intolerant and exclusive spirit, and
the contempt which some of their number poured upon
the Tarsian temple service, had aroused a bitter prejudice
and growing hostility. This feeling, like a hidden fire,
for some time had smouldered, only waiting for some
unusual opportunity to burst into open flame. While
the Roman authority and law, at that period, provided
for religious toleration in Tarsus, it could take no cognizance
of the intense bitterness, as no overt act had
occurred to warrant interference.
</p>

<p>
It was a Tarsian holiday, and the occasion of an important
festival to Apollo. For three days two children
of the family of one of the priests of the Temple had
been missing, and a rumor obtained circulation among
the lower orders of the people that the Hebrews had
stolen them, and sacrificed their bodies upon an altar
for a burnt-offering. There was no foundation for the
report, but notwithstanding its absurdity, it was widely
accepted.
</p>

<p>
Tarsus was astir. The streets were picturesque with
decoration, and lively with moving crowds and processions,
and all through the day the Temple and its great
garden were thronged with worshippers and
pleasure-<pb n="355"/><anchor id="Pg355"/>seekers. Every one was in festal costume, and innumerable
small companies were waving banners, garlands,
and palm-branches, and marching to and fro with shouts
and laughter. At the Temple there were various ceremonies,
oracular messages, predictions, and idolatries in
progress, all forming a combination such as only a great
Oriental metropolis of the period could offer.
</p>

<p>
The brazen gates which led through marble arches into
the Temple grounds were flung wide open, and a continuous
human current, seemingly from all the nations of the
earth, poured in. Parallel roads, some for those on foot
and others for horsemen or chariots, led inward toward
the intricate maze of summer-houses, bowers, ponds,
lotos-groves, and rose-trees, which occupied the heart of
the great paradisiacal resort. The number and variety
of fountains at play were amazing, and the long rows of
statues, arches, and booths stretched away in the distance
in bewildering profusion. Processions of horsemen
in rich costume and brilliant caparisonment, each carrying
offerings for the various altars, swept in to join the
great concourse. All ages, sexes, and conditions lent
their contributions to the great changing panorama of
color and beauty. There were uniformed companies, in
white or variegated colors, carrying flags, garlands, or censers,
keeping step to the music of hymns or the rhythm
of flutes and taborets, the combination of intoxicating
strains forming a vast confused symphony.
</p>

<p>
Upon a broad marble pavement of white and black design
near the centre of the widespread grounds there were
groups of gay dancers, the stroke of whose light sandalled
feet kept time to the touch of small drums and
tambou<pb n="356"/><anchor id="Pg356"/>rines. With hair floating free, bare shoulders and necks,
and robes of diaphanous texture, the voluptuousness of
their movements can scarcely be told. They were charmers,—priestesses
belonging to the Temple, each having
some part in its multiform mystical service. They were
chanting a hymn of Eros.
</p>

<lg>
<l>“Love, sons of earth! I am the Power of Love!</l>
<l>Eldest of all the gods, with Chaos born;</l>
<l>My smile sheds light along the courts above,</l>
<l>My kisses wake the eyelids of the Morn.”</l>
</lg>

<p>
Some of the trees of the groves were large,—tall branching
cedars, and evergreen oaks with glossy luxurious foliage,
casting a cool seductive shade upon the fresh clean
grass. There were sycamores, laurels, mulberries, citron-trees,
and terebinths, whose blossoms loaded the air with
a spicy intoxication. The thickets were full of birds, so
tame as to be fearless. The cooing of turtle-doves, the
song of nightingale, and the whistle of quail, added to
the unending composite of sweet sounds, shapes, and
colors. The exuberance of nature, the gracefulness of
art, and all that the genius of man could invent, combined
as if to surfeit the human senses.
</p>

<p>
Subtly intermingled with the degeneracy of such an
age there was a blind but ever-living impulse toward
some kind of worship. Man’s religious proclivities are
so strong that their exercise will find a place, even if it
be no higher than his own animal instincts.
</p>

<p>
From the standpoints of other periods, it is far from
easy to unravel the fundamental strands of life in any
given time, and justly interpret its underlying spirit.
<pb n="357"/><anchor id="Pg357"/>The autocratic rule of the sensuous consciousness is yet
everywhere supreme, but its outward manifestations constantly
take new shape. By the unreliable measurements
of men, the ethics of one age is made the standard of
judgment for those of others. The radical defect—all-prevailing
materialism—everywhere remains, but each
age shifts its moral emphasis so that its own methods
for the adoration of the lower selfhood seem good in its
own eyes. Though the period in review was eminent for
its moral corruption, the worship of the bodily creature,
in some form, after nineteen hundred years of added
experience and supposed wisdom still remains dominant.
Veils of outward legality are everywhere drawn,
and external conformity to undoubted standards more
general—but what of the great underlying sea of human
consciousness? The true barometric test of the moral
and spiritual essence of any and all ages is the quality
of thought-occupation, whether the same be boldly expressed
or subtly hidden. The world is full of veneers,
and each eye complacently looks upon those of its own
time, while it ruthlessly strips off all others. The
twenty-first century will doubtless be as much shocked
by the selfishness, pride, greed, and mad rush for place
and power, which pertain to the nineteenth, as is the
latter at the more open corruption of the age under
review.
</p>

<p>
Leander’s break with Marcius thoroughly embittered
his morbid jealousy, and snapped the only cord of outward
restraint which in any degree had held him. As
a friend and guest of the Vice Legate, possessed of a
dashing and poetic spirit, he was well known in the gay
<pb n="358"/><anchor id="Pg358"/>society of the Cilician metropolis. Vain of person, and
proud of his dramatic accomplishments, he brought them
into exercise on every possible occasion. His delicate
complexion, wavy brown hair, and dark blue eyes, with
an easy gracefulness which characterized every movement,
gave him a pleasing personality which was his
special capital. He spent much time at the baths, and
commanded their perfect service. Their oils, polishing,
and perfume in some measure concealed the flight of
years under a youthful veneer of pearly whiteness. But
the natural sparkle of his eyes was growing dull, and the
open, warm, and artless temper of earlier life had become
clouded with cynicism and acerbity.
</p>

<p>
His richly decorated chariot, which was drawn by
three snowy white horses abreast, always drew a gaping
crowd as it dashed through the Tarsian thoroughfares.
His especial pride was to be regarded as the <foreign rend="italic">arbiter elegantiarum</foreign>
of the city. His more immediate circle of
friends was often invited to his entertainments, which
consisted chiefly of his own recitations of Greek poetry
and tragedy. They frequently became tiresome, but as
his fondness for applause was notorious, it was sarcastically
bestowed <foreign rend="italic">ad nauseam</foreign>. He entered with the utmost
abandon into every spectacular display or ceremony,
his fondness for dramatic art thereby receiving exercise
and stimulation. Before ordering his chariot for his
visit to the festival he sat down to warm himself with a
deep draft of spiced Falernian. It came strongly to
mind that on many similar occasions he had started
with Marcius at his side. Now he was to go alone.
</p>

<p>
During every hour since their last interview his anger
<pb n="359"/><anchor id="Pg359"/>had increased. He, the life-long friend, cast off for an
obscure Hebrew! Impatience waxed hot, until his feeling
rapidly became absolute hatred. In some way he
would have revenge—bitter revenge. Was there not
some possible means by which he could despoil Marcius
of his official position, and rob him of his reputation?
But his popularity and power made it utterly inexpedient
to declare open enmity. Leander would bide his time,
and find a plan to secretly revenge himself, and never
rest easy until the downfall of the Vice Legate was compassed.
As for Serenus and Amabel, they were beneath
contempt.
</p>

<p>
Wrath or jealousy that is nursed grows apace, and the
enmity of Leander would have sanctioned the murder
of Marcius, if it could be brought about without any
finger of suspicion being pointed toward him.
</p>

<p>
But it was time to depart. His chariot was waiting;
and seizing the reins of his noble steeds, he joined the
great current which flowed towards the Temple and its
spacious enclosure. Arriving in due time, he entered
by the most prominent triumphal gateway, and after
ostentatiously driving several times around the broad
circular highway, left his chariot with an attendant, in
order more freely to enjoy the sights and sounds, and
indulge in the pleasures of the vast enclosure. He found
two or three friends, and with them joined in some of the
sports and games. But after a time, wearying of these,
they came upon a large booth richly ornamented with
occult art, having an inscription over the entrance:—
</p>

<p rend="center">
<q><hi rend="small">HOUSE OF MAGIC AND DIVINATION</hi>.</q>
</p>

<pb n="360"/><anchor id="Pg360"/>

<p>
Entering, they found themselves in the spacious atrium,
where each visitor waited his turn, and made his choice
as to which of the divers inner mysteries he would consult.
Out of this large reception-room many portals
opened which penetrated to unknown interiors of enchantment
and sorcery. The peculiar class to which
each belonged was indicated by occult emblems or cabalistic
signs inscribed upon the various oval valves that
opened farther inward. An attending magician interpreted
them. One led to a wizard’s cave of spells and
incantations; another to realms where converse with
shades was held; another to oracular answers and predictions;
another to charms for healing; another to the
furnishing of love philters; and finally, one was given to
curses and horrors.
</p>

<p>
Leander chose the last named. His hatred towards
Marcius flashed up as he saw the symbols, and he would
know the mystery, and perchance an instrument for enmity.
</p>

<p>
<q>I fear neither gods nor men!</q> he exclaimed; <q>and I
will acquaint myself with the worst.</q>
</p>

<p>
His friends sought enchantments of the milder forms.
</p>

<p>
He was in an impatient mood, but had not long to
wait when the curious valve leading to the department
last named swung open of its own accord, and a hoarse
voice from within, though seemingly very distant, cried,—
</p>

<p rend="center">
<q><hi rend="small">ENTER THOU THE MYSTIC SHRINE!</hi></q>
</p>

<p>
He passed in, and the valve closed behind him. He
found himself in a dimly lighted, narrow passage-way,
which he followed, that led under ground in mazy, sinuous
fashion, seemingly without end. He smiled at the
<pb n="361"/><anchor id="Pg361"/>slight weird feeling which stole upon him, but pushed
on. He feared nothing, for he believed nothing. There
were no such things as visions, spectres, or shades. He
had come for amusement—or rather, if possible, to find
a way of revenge.
</p>

<p>
At length the passage widened into a cave of indefinite
dimensions. It was but dimly lighted by a
small fire in a recess of jagged rocks. The walls of
the cave in other directions seemed to be composed
of an indefinable mist of unknown depth, upon which
flashed a dim tremulous phosphorescence. Over the fire
was suspended a caldron, the contents of which seethed
and bubbled, emitting a pungent vapor that wreathed itself
overhead in illy defined forms that seemed to crawl
and leap. Upon a shelf suspended in mid-air without
visible support, an assortment of tiny phials containing
various colored liquids gleamed with an unearthly light,
and near by hung small bundles of dried herbs and roots.
Upon a rough iron tripod stood a grotesque statue of
the Hecate, through whose eyes shone a dull red light,
as if they were heated by an inner flame. Several skeletons
and many more skulls were arranged at different
angles, the eyes of which remained in their places,
shining with a red light of their own. Leander was
the cynosure of them all.
</p>

<p>
He looked about him for a moment, taking in the
various details, and then burst into loud laughter.
</p>

<p>
<q>By Bacchus! an artistic combination to impress infants!
But where, oh, where, lingereth the presiding
siren? The combination seemeth to run itself! Come
out! Thy caldron needs stirring!</q>
</p>

<pb n="362"/><anchor id="Pg362"/>

<p>
Then he gave another hearty laugh at his own wit and
eloquence. The reverberations which indefinitely repeated
themselves through the distant passages sounded
like a multitudinous mocking chorus.
</p>

<p>
<q>Shades of Tophet! the acoustic properties are well
provided!</q>
</p>

<p>
He gave another loud call for the sorceress in charge.
The sound of his voice seemed split into a hundred
fragments—a chaos of weird echoes upon all keys.
</p>

<p>
<q>Go on with your cackling! I welcome every demon
that sails his bark upon the Cocytus!</q>
</p>

<p>
But as a female form of gigantic proportions slowly
emerged from the background, his heart gave a leap.
</p>

<p>
Covering her dishevelled gray locks was a tall, pointed
red turban; her mouth, partly open, showed two irregular
rows of long, dark teeth, and her large stony eyes
were fastened upon him with a freezing stare. Her
features were ashy gray and unearthly.
</p>

<p>
But in spite of appearances, Leander gathered himself
together, and with a chuckle exclaimed,—
</p>

<p>
<q>By the thirst of Bacchus! I adjudge this a strong
and artistic stage-setting for a Greek tragedy!</q>
</p>

<p>
Then, striking an attitude, he began, in impassioned
style, to recite some lines from one of the dramas of
Sophocles.
</p>

<p>
After listening a while the horrible gigantic Shape
began slowly to turn away, and exclaimed in hoarse,
hollow tones,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Enough! I surrender!</q>
</p>

<p>
Leander neatly turned the exclamation into a compliment.
</p>

<pb n="363"/><anchor id="Pg363"/>

<p>
<q>My oratory conquers gods, men, or she-devils!</q>
</p>

<p>
He then addressed the retiring Shape.
</p>

<p>
<q>Stay, I pray thee! Thou art not comely, but peradventure
thou canst serve me! I would have none
of thy incantations, but thou hast in store a variety of
potions. Art thou skilled in their preparation?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For more than twoscore years have I distilled and
cunningly concentrated the occult and deadly forces of
nature,</q> said the Shape with a ghastly grin. <q>I am
a daughter of the Etrurians, and their wonderful secrets
and enchantments have come down to me from the dim
past. I have philters for the loveless, promises of treasure
for the needy, and potions for revenge, for tragedy,
for blight, and for destiny! What wilt thou?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hast thou a blight which will very slowly, but with
grim certainty, dull the reason, destroy the wisdom,
and hasten to decay before the wonted time all the
faculties of the Mind?</q>
</p>

<p>
The Shape stretched out her long, bony fingers and
took one of the small phials, and holding it before her
stony eyes, replied,—
</p>

<p>
<q>In color and taste like water; yet he who takes it in
any form, in three years will become a drivelling idiot!
The brain! the brain! It slowly scorches, and nothing
can put it out! It will mingle with water or even Falernian!</q>
</p>

<p>
The Shape gave a malicious leer.
</p>

<p>
<q>I believe neither in shades, spectres, nor enchantments,
but of chemistry am persuaded! But how can I
be assured of what thou sayest?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will give thee a sign of my power!</q>
</p>

<pb n="364"/><anchor id="Pg364"/>

<p>
<q>As thou wilt.</q>
</p>

<p>
The Shape, taking an empty phial, poured into it a
portion of the contents of several of the dark liquids, and
the mixture was clear and colorless.
</p>

<p>
<q>By the eyes of yonder Hecate, thou hast power! and
now the price of thy potion?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>From thee, O dramatic ranter, a full purse of gold,
for thou art rich.</q>
</p>

<p>
Leander drew from an inner secret fold in his tunic a
small purse filled with gold, and taking the phial, carefully
deposited it in the place from whence he had taken
the coin.
</p>

<p>
He chuckled to himself as he thought of his new-found
secret for revenge upon Marcius, and was about to turn
towards the entrance when the hag interposed,—
</p>

<p>
<q>A mutual oath of secrecy before thou departest.</q>
</p>

<p>
Then she grasped his hand with her long, bony fingers,
and placing it upon the head of the Hecate of the burning
eyes, covered it with one of her own.
</p>

<p>
<q>Repeat after me!</q>
</p>

<p>
Leander repeated the oath.
</p>

<p>
<q>May all the gods curse me, if I reveal aught of this
transaction!</q>
</p>

<p>
Leander turned to go.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou art the first who hath entered here and not
quailed! Farewell!</q>
</p>

<p>
Leander soon found himself again amid the crowds in
the sunshine of the garden.
</p>

<p>
Was it a dream?
</p>

<p>
He thrust his hand under the secret fold of his tunic,
and the phial was there.
</p>

<pb n="365"/><anchor id="Pg365"/>

<p>
It was now late in the afternoon, and the streets, leading
from the Temple and its grounds towards the lower
part of the city, were filled with groups of gay revellers
on their return. There was an easy air of careless enjoyment
which possessed all classes and ages. Young men
and boys were waving banners or singing songs, and the
flitting forms of women and girls in picturesque attire,
with their ringing, playful laughter, were everywhere to
be seen.
</p>

<p>
In one of the main thoroughfares where these merry
throngs were passing was the largest Jewish synagogue
in Tarsus. During the afternoon there had been a special
religious ceremonial, and the congregation emerged
in a mass just as some of the crowds from the festival
were passing by. The recent growing prejudice, but
more especially the rumor of the missing children, had
stirred up a bitter hatred which needed but a spark to
cause an outburst of open warfare.
</p>

<p>
No greater contrast could be imagined in appearance
than that between the lively votaries of the Tarsian deities,
and the stiff, conceited, and austere Hebrews. The
disciples of the synagogue wore long robes with broad
borders and girdles, and mingled here and there with
them were priests with tall cup-shaped turbans, breastplates,
and broad phylacteries. Their measured pace,
solemn countenances, and proud, exclusive bearing
seemed like a spoken rebuke and even an insult to the
great current which was flowing by from the Temple of
Apollo. Some who were nearest began to utter derisive
cries against the Israelites.
</p>

<p>
<q>Down with the bigots!</q>
</p>

<pb n="366"/><anchor id="Pg366"/>

<p>
<q>Behold the murderers, who take children for burnt-offerings!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Drive them from Tarsus!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The gods curse them!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Woe to the circumcision!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hurl them into the Cydnus!</q>
</p>

<p>
These were among the cries which fell upon the ears
of the Hebrews as they poured out of the synagogue.
The excitement grew apace, and the rabble began to
close in around them, hurling such missiles as were at
hand.
</p>

<p>
Soon the attack became general.
</p>

<p>
Turbans, breastplates, phylacteries, and all other distinctive
insignia were stripped off, and many men,
women, and children were beaten and wounded. The
<foreign rend="italic">mêlée</foreign>, so quickly started, became general, and spread
over a large space. The cry, <q>Murderers of children!</q>
was taken up in every direction.
</p>

<p>
For a while the Jews rallied, and essayed to defend
themselves, but being overwhelmingly outnumbered,
began to scatter and flee as best they could. Some
escaped through side streets and lanes, and many were
borne down, bleeding and wounded.
</p>

<p>
Rebecca was among the number. Though caring
little for the ceremonials of her people, she still outwardly
observed them from strength of habit and association,
and in compliance with the earnest requests of
her father.
</p>

<p>
In the great tumult she became separated from all
her friends, and twice was thrown down and trampled
upon. At length, with torn garments and her
beauti<pb n="367"/><anchor id="Pg367"/>ful hair streaming behind, she darted through a narrow
passage into an open square, still followed by a
small rabble of the lowest class.
</p>

<p>
Marcius had taken no notice of the festival, he and
Serenus having gone upon a drive up the right bank
of the Cydnus. They were returning when rumors of
the outbreak came to their ears. Marcius hurried on
in order to exercise his authority in its suppression.
</p>

<p>
They quickly turned a corner, when at a little distance
a dishevelled woman was seen running rapidly
toward them, screaming, and closely followed by a mob.
She was faint and ready to fall; but seeing, though
not recognizing them, besought their aid.
</p>

<p>
Marcius drove rapidly forward, standing with whip in
hand, and with an air of authority demanded order.
</p>

<p>
<q>Back! I say, and leave her alone! Disperse, ye
rioters!</q>
</p>

<p>
As she came near, Serenus caught a full view of her
beautiful face, and could not be mistaken.
</p>

<p>
<q>As I live, it is Rebecca!</q>
</p>

<p>
Marcius stopped his horses, announced his office, and
the mob quickly melted away. Then lifting the exhausted
Rebecca into the carriage with them, Marcius
drove rapidly to his palace.
</p>

<p>
They tenderly bore her unconscious form within, and
deposited it in the apartments of Serenus, in the care
of Amabel.

<epigraph><p>
The links of circumstance are securely welded into the chain of life
so that none can be lost or missed. The effect of to-day is only transmuted
into the cause of to-morrow.
</p>
</epigraph>

<p>
Marcius was deeply impressed by the face of Rebecca.
There was an indefinable peculiarity about her
charming features which the flight of years had not
effaced. But when, where, or under what circumstances
he had seen her, he was utterly at a loss to conceive.
</p>

<p>
From the moment of her rescue from the mob, until
with the help of Serenus he delivered her to the care
of Amabel, he seemed to be under a peculiar abstraction.
But mingled with an indefinable shock at a sense
of some mysterious recognition, there was a surprise,
even under the untoward circumstances, at her unwonted
beauty and evident refinement. His peculiar feelings
were an enigma to himself. Why should one of a race so
generally disesteemed, even though comely, so move him?
</p>

<p>
The injuries which Rebecca had received at the hands
of the mob proved to be severe. After attending to immediate
requirements for her relief, Serenus proceeded
to acquaint her parents concerning her. Remembering
that she had made known to him while in Jerusalem that
she was the daughter of Benoni, he hastened to find him.
</p>

<pb n="369"/><anchor id="Pg369"/>

<p>
As the father was one of the more prominent of the
Hebrew citizens of Tarsus, Serenus found it easy to
ascertain his place of abode. Pursuing a thoroughfare
which led to the Orontes Gate, in the northwestern part
of the city, he soon approached the family domicile.
Upon the outside all was peaceful and serene. The
broad terraces were dotted with clusters of flowering
plants and shrubs which filled the air with their fragrance.
The silvery Cydnus lay spread out in the near
foreground, and winding paths, with flights of steps, led
directly down to the shore. The house, Hebraic in
design, was simply though rather richly embellished by
symbolic emblems peculiar to the Chosen People, and
Serenus was impressed by the beauty and taste everywhere
evident.
</p>

<p>
The door was opened in response to his knock, and
upon entering he found great sorrow and confusion.
Benoni and his wife had barely escaped from the mob,
and had reached home but a short time before bruised
and exhausted. But forgetting themselves, they were
bitterly bewailing the loss of Rebecca, supposing that
she had perished in the street.
</p>

<p>
<q>Peace be unto this house! In the midst of your
affliction I bring good tidings!</q> said Serenus after his
hasty but warm salutation. <q>I am a Hebrew, lately
arrived from the Holy City, and have much joy in making
known to you that your daughter hath been saved
from the rabble.</q>
</p>

<p>
Benoni closely scanned the tall, graceful form and
clear, handsome face of Serenus, and they brought a
terrible scene of the past vividly to his memory.
</p>

<pb n="370"/><anchor id="Pg370"/>

<p>
<q>The God of Israel be praised! I shall never forget
thee! Thou art again a minister of mercy, and I thank
thee for thy compassion.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou dost remember my face?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Did I not behold thee in the Temple-court, when in
the mad panic thou didst lift Rebecca from my shoulders
and bear her to a place of safety? Did not mine
eyes see thee from the house-top in the line of captives
on thy way to prison, when Almon, mine host, made
known to me that thou wert he who saved Saulus from
the thieves and brought him to the inn at midnight?
May thou be doubly blessed! But I am grieved on thy
behalf! How could Saulus count thee—as—his—enemy?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I beseech thee think no more of the things of the
past. I have come to inform thee that thy daughter
Rebecca is at the palace of the Vice Legate, tenderly
cared for by my wife Amabel?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou dost gladden my heart! And hast thou assurance
that she is not sorely wounded?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Recovery will come in due season, but perchance
for a few days it may be prudent that she remain.</q>
</p>

<p>
Rebecca’s mother also poured out her thanks to Serenus,
but being overcome by faintness, was obliged to
seek retirement.
</p>

<p>
Benoni was in a state of great perplexity. The events
of the past in the Holy City, and the unexpected riotous
outbreak of the day, filled him with questioning and disquietude,
which were increased by the sudden appearance
of Serenus. Thrice the guardian angel of his family,
could this man be <q>the enemy of Saulus</q>? Moreover,
<pb n="371"/><anchor id="Pg371"/>was it possible that he was the betrayer of the religion of
his fathers?
</p>

<p>
While rejoicing over the escape of Rebecca, and feeling
grateful for the past and present kindness of Serenus,
a current of the bitterness and prejudice which possessed
him at Jerusalem momentarily made itself felt. Too
weak also from the terrible experience of the day to visit
Rebecca, he was greatly troubled, and bowed his head
in silence and tears.
</p>

<p>
After a little delay, Serenus uttered a few warm words
of encouragement, and started to take his leave, promising
to come again on the morrow and bring further tidings
of Rebecca, and peradventure perform any other service.
</p>

<p>
Then Benoni relented and aroused himself.
</p>

<p>
<q>Tarry for a little, I pray thee, that we may have further
converse.</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus again seated himself by his side, gently taking
one of his hands in his own, as if he would soothe his
distresses.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold our many trials work together for good! Thy
daughter will be restored, and thou made glad!</q>
</p>

<p>
The hardness of Benoni melted before the friendly
warmth of Serenus.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thanks be to thee for thy words of comfort. Behold
thou didst save both Saulus and Rebecca from the hand
of the destroyer; yea, twice thou hast given back my
daughter, and I love and honor thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou dost commend me overmuch! To Marcius,
the Vice Legate, is due the rescue of Rebecca from the
hands of the rabble. He is a noble Roman, and will
have respect unto thee and thy house.</q>
</p>

<pb n="372"/><anchor id="Pg372"/>

<p>
<q>Is he thy friend?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, verily!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And thou a Hebrew?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I was born a Hebrew!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I marvel at what thou sayest!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A Roman may have a warm heart!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I marvel again! but if so, I am persuaded that thou
must have warmed it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is an affection, not born of race or position,
and even the Vice Legate of Tarsus hath begun to feel
somewhat of its glow!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But doth not he worship the Tarsian gods?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Aforetime and formally, yea! but he is reaching out
after a Higher,—the God of all the earth!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But behold the God of Israel ruleth all the earth!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And all the peoples of the earth are his children!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And thou a Hebrew! I cannot understand what
thou sayest. It is written that Moses called the Lord a
Man of War. Hath he not then enmity against the
Gentiles?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He hath enmity against no man!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Again thou speakest strange things! Thy spirit is
wise and good and thy heart full of charity, but thou
lightly regardest the things that are written.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Verily the springs of God are in the inner man!
The things that are written may be expedient and profitable
in their day and generation, but they are not yet
fully perfected. Behold the written law is a schoolmaster
leading towards Truth!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Sayest thou that the revelation of God is not perfected
in the law as handed down to our fathers?</q>
</p>

<pb n="373"/><anchor id="Pg373"/>

<p>
<q>Nay! God is ever revealing himself in divers ways,
and will never cease.</q>
</p>

<p>
Again Benoni bowed his head in bewilderment. At
length, lifting his eyes towards the face of Serenus, he
inquired,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Canst thou forgive Saulus for his bitter persecution
of thee and thy friends?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have forgiven him from the beginning!</q>
</p>

<p>
Benoni’s eyes filled with tears as he put his arms
about the young man, embracing him warmly. Serenus
arose to depart.
</p>

<p>
<q>I will bring thee tidings from Rebecca on the morrow,
and peradventure thou mayest be able to visit her.</q>
</p>

<p>
The conflict of the ages—that which hath torn innumerable
souls before and since—the Spirit <foreign rend="italic">versus</foreign> the
Letter—waxed strong in the mind of Benoni for hours
after Serenus had taken his departure.
</p>

<p>
Nothing less than some upheaval of marvellous force
can change a strong current of chronic dogmatic prejudice.
It may be interrupted, but there is a mighty tendency
for the stream to return to its well-worn channel.
</p>

<p>
The vague mystery of some dim recollection of the
face of Rebecca increased the interest which Marcius
otherwise would have felt in her welfare and improvement.
Losing no time after their arrival, he despatched
a messenger to call his own physician, and also sent for
two skilful nurses who were to alternate in their attendance
under the general supervision of Amabel. Then
he proceeded without delay to take all possible means,
in connection with the Legate and other Roman officials,
for the suppression of the tumult.
</p>

<pb n="374"/><anchor id="Pg374"/>

<p>
A cohort of soldiers was hastily ordered into service;
but as the Hebrews had all fled to their homes, except
the small number that were killed or wounded, and the
rabble scattered, they found little to do. So many of
the leaders of the attack as could be identified were
placed under arrest, and the Hebrews assured of future
liberty and protection. A proclamation also was issued,
over the imperial seal of Cæsar, commanding religious
toleration.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of the same day Marcius was alone in
his private office reviewing the events which had happened.
Crowning the strange impressions already noted
was another, which was unwonted and distinct. Transcending
the romance of the rescue of the beautiful and
mysterious Jewess, a peculiar gladness welled up within
him at the feeling of having succored the weak and innocent
in the hour of trial. It was the first purely moral
upheaval in the soul of Marcius of that unique satisfaction
which grows out of a beneficent act well done.
Not that he took any credit for having performed a
simple manly duty, but rather felt a spontaneous and
genuine thankfulness that the circumstances had conferred
a great privilege upon him. As he looked back
over a past so long ruled by selfishness and passion, he
was surprised at the revelation of the luxury of doing
good, even though it came in the line of official obligation.
He almost felt a reverence for the simple Hebrew
maiden, who had been the instrument of revealing the
loftiest consciousness within him that he had ever experienced.
A hitherto unknown beneficent impulse had
been awakened within him that would never again go
<pb n="375"/><anchor id="Pg375"/>back to latency. It included ministry to the weak, protection
to the innocent, and help to the helpless, whenever
opportunity might offer. Though to the world, or
even the average man of affairs, the incident would
seem trivial, yet a door, before unknown, had been
opened, and Marcius, the Roman, had added a cubit to
his spiritual stature.
</p>

<p>
After Rebecca was borne into the palace, she remained
a full hour in a state of unconsciousness. Willing hands
and loving hearts exercised themselves in every form of
helpful devotion. No bones were broken, but the terrible
shock, with the severe bruises received while under the
feet of the mob, made her condition of serious import.
</p>

<p>
Upon opening her eyes, she was bewildered on account
of the strange surroundings. But the bright
cheerful face of Amabel, who was holding her hand and
stroking her forehead, reassured her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Where am I? and what has happened?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou art surrounded by warm friends, and peace and
joy belong to thee. Be not disquieted, for all is well!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have had a terrible dream—nay, it must be more
than a dream, for I am in a strange place, and cannot
move!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou art in the palace of the Vice Legate of Tarsus!
He snatched thee from the hand of the cruel horde, and
brought thee here and placed thee in my charge. Our
love, care, and healing influence will restore thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thy kindly young face seemeth familiar! Wilt thou
be pleased to tell me concerning thyself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am Amabel, the daughter of Rabban Gamaliel of
Jerusalem, and wife of Serenus!</q>
</p>

<pb n="376"/><anchor id="Pg376"/>

<p>
<q>My love and thanks go out to thee for thy goodly
service.</q>
</p>

<p>
She was then made acquainted with the escape of her
father and mother; but soon a confused mingling of past
scenes, with faintness from the terrible shock of the afternoon,
overcame her, and she sank into a deep slumber.
</p>

<p>
After two or three hours she awoke visibly improved.
Though very weak, she now clearly recalled all the
events of the day, excepting those during the period of
her unconsciousness. As she looked up, both Serenus
and Amabel were seated by her side. The face of the
former at once brought before her the well-remembered
scenes of the Holy City. The panic of the Feast of
Weeks, their subsequent conversation, the procession of
prisoners, and other events of the persecution, were all
vividly recalled. Yet this was <q>the friend of Saulus.</q>
Then she thought of the previous day, when Serenus
and Amabel coming from the Nereid were driven
through the streets in the company of that Roman
whose dark face was so deeply engraven upon her
memory.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is much that seemeth mysterious to me!</q> she
exclaimed; and then turning towards Serenus said,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Of a verity thou wert the preserver both of Saulus
and myself in the Holy City, and now, behold thou hast
appeared in Tarsus and saved me from the fury of the
mob! But I cannot understand</q>—
</p>

<p>
<q>Of a truth it was not I, but Marcius, the Vice Legate,
who delivered thee from danger and brought thee to
this place of refuge. Perchance I rendered some service,
but to him thy thanks are due for thine escape.</q>
</p>

<pb n="377"/><anchor id="Pg377"/>

<p>
Rebecca again closed her eyes for a few moments,
but her memory was busy.
</p>

<p>
Marvel of Marvels!
</p>

<p>
Noticing her confusion, Serenus quietly observed,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou wilt know all in due time, but pray let slumber
gently seal thine eyelids until the morrow. We
will aid thee to realize the Present Help, and through
a spiritual strength which shall be thine, thou shalt
feel new life with the rising of the sun!</q>
</p>

<p>
Silence then prevailed, and she sank into a sweet,
restful slumber.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Light of my Life!</q> said Amabel in a low tone,
<q>I am filled with the remembrance of thy gracious ministry
when I passed down to the border of the tomb
in my father’s house. All that then seemed so adverse
was but the pathway through which I was led into the
Truth! And now, touching this trial, peradventure it
will be the means of bringing great light and peace
into the soul of Rebecca.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, verily, Love of my Heart! Good springeth
forth from evil! And now let us be silent channels
whereby the presence of the Universal Good shall become
manifest in her.</q>
</p>

<p>
Profound stillness then prevailed.
</p>

<p>
The place seemed hallowed.
</p>

<p>
As the dim evening light shone softly upon the closed
eyes and fair cheeks of Rebecca, a sweet smile wreathed
her lips. Perchance she was dreaming of peace, love,
and an overcoming faith.
</p>

<p>
The two young disciples of the New Faith sat near
her as the moments passed silently by.
</p>

<pb n="378"/><anchor id="Pg378"/>

<p>
A Voice spoke through them, but not in words.
<q>Child of God! Thou art a spark of Immortal Flame!
an image of the Universal Spirit! It is thine to govern
and harmonize the outward form. Thou hast new
life already! God is Spirit, and his dwelling-place is
with his offspring. He is thy Life, Love, and Strength,
through the understanding of the laws of thy being.
Behold the very breath of God is within thee! His
strength is freely thine own!</q>
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
Serenus retired from the room.
</p>

<p>
The next morning found a very marked improvement
in the condition of Rebecca. She was surprised at the
unwonted joy and gladness which like a fountain spontaneously
sprung up within her. There was also a
great recovery in her bodily condition.
</p>

<p>
Opening her eyes, with a calm cheerfulness she warmly
greeted Amabel, who was already by her side,—
</p>

<p>
<q>The morning light hath brought me peace, dear
Amabel! I feel such an assurance of strength and
happiness that it seemeth a mystery.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Peradventure thou hast some inner kindling of the
New Faith!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell me of it; for even the bodily presence of you—its
disciples—bringeth a peculiar benediction!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We are but its instruments of spiritual ministration!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Cometh it down from the God of the Hebrews in
answer to your petitions?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold the presence of God filleth all things, both
great and small, and his loving favor hath no constraint
<pb n="379"/><anchor id="Pg379"/>of tribe or nation! We need not beg, for no willingness
is lacking with him. To open our souls to the abundance
which is already provided, comprehendeth the
Spirit of the New Faith!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Peradventure I felt some faint beginnings of its presence
within me while I was yet in the Holy City, but
Serenus and thyself have it in living fulness!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold the power and love which inspire may come
through silent communication from another soul! The
Spirit speaketh through one to another to the inner ear.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How mysterious, and yet how beautiful!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>When the Image of God within is discovered, in due
time it maketh its fruits manifest in the outer and seen.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Hath Marcius, the Vice Legate, accepted the New
Faith?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He hath not yet fully avowed it, but is possessed of
a growing desire to know the Truth. Though a Roman,
the dawn of a higher consciousness already hath shone
into his soul, and perchance the good seed which Serenus
hath sown will spring forth into a full harvest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It appeareth that you are his friends and guests. I
rejoice that it hath so come to pass, but it seemeth
strange!</q>
</p>

<p>
Amabel then briefly related the whole story of the
shipwreck, and of the friendliness and growing interest
of Marcius in their teaching.
</p>

<p>
After listening to the narrative, Rebecca closed her
eyes, while Memory held its graphic pictures before her.
</p>

<p>
Back, back to the evening on the Cydnus—the storm—the
scene in the palace—the boyish, brotherly devotion
of Saulus, and the outcome of complete salvation.
</p>

<pb n="380"/><anchor id="Pg380"/>

<p>
Then she quickly roamed over the succeeding years,—the
change in Saulus—his terrible persecutions—her
life in the Holy City—and on, on, down to the events
of the past two days.
</p>

<p>
Verily, life was a mysterious labyrinth!
</p>

<p>
She was <hi rend="italic">again</hi> in a palace of Marcius!
</p>

<p>
But Marcius was another Marcius; the same only in
name; the friend of her friends, and the doer of good
deeds. Nay, more. He was her deliverer from death,
and his house her place of refuge.
</p>

<p>
No! he could never recognize her!
</p>

<p>
She resolved to lock up the secret of the first Marcius!
</p>

<p>
He was forgiven, forgotten—blotted out!
</p>

<p>
On the third day after the rescue of Rebecca she
had recovered her wonted health and strength. Benoni,
visiting her on the previous afternoon, fondly hoped
that she might return with him, but upon the cordial
invitation of her benefactors, consented that she should
remain a little longer. Her interest in the New Faith
grew apace, and her love and respect for its two young
exponents were unbounded. The rapidity of her restoration
appeared miraculous to all who understood not
the signs which outwardly witnessed the new spiritual
Power. The nurses which Marcius provided were not
needed, and the physician made but the visit of the first
day.
</p>

<p>
Since the day when he snatched her from the jaws
of death, Marcius had not seen Rebecca, but manifested
<pb n="382"/><anchor id="Pg382"/>his interest by frequent inquiries concerning her welfare.
Some part of each day he sought the company
of Serenus, and his interest in their conversation, and
regard for what he called the new Spiritual Philosophy,
steadily increased. On the third evening, learning of
Rebecca’s virtual recovery, he expressed the earnest
wish that she, with Serenus and Amabel, should sup
with him upon the evening following. It would be a
quiet but fitting celebration of her notable recovery.
</p>

<p>
Upon being informed by Serenus of the proffered
honor, she would have pleaded some excuse, but feeling
a great obligation to her kind host, and also that
it would please her guardian angels of the New Faith,
she accepted the invitation. Through the kindness of
Serenus she was supplied from her home with everything
that was fitting for her appearance at the festivity,
so that with the delicate discrimination and assistance
of Amabel she lacked nothing.
</p>

<p>
The evening came, and Rebecca’s fair face, though
slightly paler than usual, was charming to behold. With
features of rare symmetry, and complexion of a delicate
brunette, her skin was of such transparency that
the ruddiness beneath it clearly shone through. Her
head, classic in shape and slightly below the average
size, was set upon a neck and shoulders well turned, and
graceful in pose and shapeliness. Her jet black hair
was lightly gathered up under a cap of silken gauze
with a dainty embroidery of golden threads, and a network
of delicate chains adorned with small precious
stones encircled her neck. She wore simple but rich
flowing robes, in harmony with her faultless form,
com<pb n="383"/><anchor id="Pg383"/>pelling attention not to detail, but to general completeness
and proportion.
</p>

<p>
Who can estimate the refining and elevating influence
of true and ideal beauty? No symmetrical soul can fail
to be thrilled by its quality, and the admiration bestowed
upon it is repaid by a reflection of its transforming
potency. Everything, whether beautiful or otherwise,
is ever busy in the subtle moulding of living and impressible
forms around it into its own image. The
lesson of Pygmalion and his fair creation symbolizes
the poetic and artistic truth of a vital and universal
principle.
</p>

<p>
But the outward form and costume of Rebecca were
the unimportant elements of her charming presence.
The purity and artlessness of soul shining through the
visible personality formed the real attractiveness of the
daughter of Benoni. The costume, and even the beautiful
form, were simple accessories, like the external setting
of a gem.
</p>

<p>
As the hour of the repast drew near, the trio wended
their way through a long corridor, paved with mosaic,
then, passing two portals, entered the atrium or front
court of the palace. Here Marcius would receive them.
The entrances to the various rooms, with their walks, alcoves,
and stairways, extended around on three sides,
while on the fourth, beyond a massive wall of marble,
were the palace gardens, containing flower-beds, shrubberies,
fountains, and statues, with here and there a
spreading plane, fig, or palm tree.
</p>

<p>
The court opened to the blue sky above, except a
space covered by a large velarium, which was spread as
<pb n="384"/><anchor id="Pg384"/>a shelter from the rays of the sun during the afternoon.
The impluvium, or rain-water tank, guarded by rails of
polished metal, received its contents through grotesque
gargoyles of the same material, and near by a fountain
poured forth a volume of spray into a huge round marble
basin, surrounded with anemones and lilies. The pavement
of the atrium was of white and dark red marbles
in handsome design, and the walls decorated with
carved panels, upon which were representations of fantastic
birds, griffins, fauns, and centaurs. Along the
sides a continuous divan or resting-place was supplied
with soft, movable cushions, and stools in front.
</p>

<p>
Marcius appeared soon after the announcement of
their arrival. After a simple introduction, he gave
Rebecca a cordial greeting,—
</p>

<p>
<q>I give thee welcome, and have pleasure in thy speedy
restoration.</q>
</p>

<p>
Rebecca glanced timidly up into the face of the Roman,
half expecting that the dark, stern visage of perfidious
memory would be disturbing beyond control, so
that her agitation would be evident. She had forgotten
for the moment that the former Marcius was no more,
and that this was another. Though the general contour
of form and feature was recalled, the hard lines of
brutality and sensuality had disappeared, while those of
a manly and kindly dignity had taken their place. There
was a sympathetic light in his eyes, a calm nobility of
demeanor, and a respectful and delicate consideration
which were delightful and unexpected. Even the voice
of well-remembered harshness was rich, amiable, and
friendly.
</p>

<pb n="385"/><anchor id="Pg385"/>

<p>
Rebecca was so astonished at the completeness of the
change that a well-defined flush upon her cheeks heightened
the charm of her appearance. The severe ordeal
which she had consented to undergo from force of circumstances,
and out of consideration for Serenus and
Amabel, suddenly lost its unpleasantness, and composure
and self-command were immediately regained.
</p>

<p>
She responded to the hearty greeting, and in a manner
of quiet dignity expressed a cordial thankfulness for his
kindness in her timely rescue and generous hospitality.
</p>

<p>
Pending the announcement of the serving of the
supper, they seated themselves for a brief converse in
the court. Marcius continued to address Rebecca.
</p>

<p>
<q>As a Roman citizen, and especially as Vice Legate
of Tarsus, I have much shame at the cruel persecution
which so suddenly broke out against thy people. It was
unforeseen, and care shall be taken that the offence hath
no repetition. But I have a peculiar gladness that my
brother Serenus and I were able to render thee aid in
the time of need. But verily it is to him that the
praise is meet. But for his presence and teaching I
should have been elsewhere.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold, my lord Marcius, he abounded with noble deeds
while in Jerusalem. I could tell thee much concerning
certain things that happened there during my sojourn.</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus interposed,—
</p>

<p>
<q>I beseech you, my friends, bestow no undue praise;
for if any good cometh through my hand, it is not I,
but the Spirit of Truth which worketh through me.</q>
</p>

<p>
Amabel turned her eyes lovingly upon her husband,
and said,—
</p>

<pb n="386"/><anchor id="Pg386"/>

<p>
<q>Behold I have learned that when the Spirit of Truth
taketh possession of a soul it becometh one with him, so
that they are no longer twain! The New Faith, which
is the awakening of the Spirit already within, cometh
into manifestation in the deeds performed.</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus gave her an approving smile. <q>Thou hast
spoken wisely. The inner or spiritual self is the veritable
man, and he waiteth for the comprehension of the
divine sonship.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I perceive that the sensuous or flesh-man is not truly
man at all,</q> said Marcius. <q>How all the so-called philosophies
of the world have erred! Doth it not seem
marvellous that I, a Roman, have so soon become convinced
of the truth and beauty of the New Faith? At
times I feel doubtful of my identity, and wonder if I am
myself!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou wert not changed by the logic and reasoning of
the intellect,</q> said Serenus, <q>for a religious belief from
without is slow and uncertain in its operation. But when
there was commended to thee the natural outworking of
the Godlike image within, anon thou felt the New Faith
living in thy heart, and needed not an argument, after
the manner of men.</q>
</p>

<p>
Rebecca, turning towards Serenus, and recalling their
conversation in the Holy City, observed,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Verily, I believe that from my early youth I have felt
some quickening of the Spirit in the depths of my heart,
but knew not what it might be. Being taught that the
faith of the Chosen People was handed down from without,
its ceremonial formality smothered the inner flame.
But the touch of thy faith, which thou gavest me on the
<pb n="387"/><anchor id="Pg387"/>day of the mad rush in the Temple court, kindled a new
life of which I had but a dim perception before. And
now, behold since I have been with Amabel, it hath
waxed stronger!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am moved to confess,</q> said Marcius, <q>that I loathed
the manner of my early life even before I knew Serenus
and the New Faith. Once I heard a voice from beyond
the borders of the grave which rebuked me, and showed
plainly the life of the unseen, and that virtue hath its
reward, and vice its natural penalty. Then I became
thoughtful, and repented of many of my evil deeds. But
yet I remained long in the ignorance or twilight of Truth,
until the sunlight of the New Faith, which hath come to
me through Serenus, quickly dispelled the darkness that
surrounded me. This not so much by his words of teaching,
as by the contagion of the Spirit that filleth him.</q>
</p>

<p>
A summons came from the triclinium, and Marcius
arose to conduct them thither. Being the guest of honor,
Rebecca was invited to lead the way with the host, and
they started, side by side, through a spacious corridor.
</p>

<p>
<q>Pardon me, if I confess that thy fair face calleth up
some dim fancy of the past. How deceitful is the imagination,
and how confusing!</q>
</p>

<p>
The heart of Rebecca gave a great leap, but she maintained
the outward semblance of calmness.
</p>

<p>
<q>Of all our faculties perhaps it is the most commonly
undisciplined,</q> she replied; <q>but, perchance we may
tame and cultivate it, and increase its usefulness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou speakest discreetly. Our new philosophy showeth
that when rightly employed everything is helpful,
which must include even the imagination.</q>
</p>

<pb n="388"/><anchor id="Pg388"/>

<p>
<q>Yea, I am learning to see the good whichever way
I turn. What a joy to live in a world where we can embellish
every person and thing with our divine thought
concerning them!</q>
</p>

<p>
When unobserved, Marcius cast another quick, tender
glance upon the face of Rebecca, and finally dismissed
all impression of any possible past meeting. Nothing
could be more improbable.
</p>

<p>
In its place came a peculiar enchantment. Such a
revelation of her beauty burst forth in his soul that it
filled him with surprise and delight. But though her
comeliness of person was fascinating, this was unimportant
and superficial. An adoration, and even reverence,
filled him, which were without alloy. His high station
had brought before him many proud and beautiful women
of his own nation, who were refined and attractive, but
this modest Hebrew maiden almost seemed to belong to
another planet. His soul was uplifted in a transport of
delight. Every step by her side gave him the feeling
that he was upon consecrated ground.
</p>

<p>
These thoughts and experiences flashed through his
mind with the force and rapidity of a tropical tempest.
</p>

<p>
He stepped over a boundary line into a delectable
land almost before he was aware of it. The paradise
discovered was Love. Such a love he had never before
known. Devotion of a depth and power of which he
would have been utterly incapable at any previous time
sprung up within him. What was rank, position, wealth,
or even outward grace! His soul arose from its former
state to the full adoration of neighboring soul-beauty.
Until now he never had known the nature of real love.
</p>

<pb n="389"/><anchor id="Pg389"/>

<p>
As they passed through the last portal into the triclinium,
Marcius was strangely silent and abstracted.
The world had been made over, and all things were new
since leaving the atrium a few minutes before.
</p>

<p>
The repast, though perfect in quality, was simple
rather than ostentatious. Marcius, with a fine instinct,
had already learned, and even felt, that the exponents
of the New Faith, while thoroughly appreciative of
beauty, were quiet in their tastes, and carried their moderation
into all things.
</p>

<p>
There was a profusion of flowers, and an abundance
of handsome appointments, but no lares or penates upon
the table, neither were any libations poured to the gods.
But when all had reclined in their places, there was a
brief interval of silent thanks and aspiration with bowed
heads, which was spontaneous rather than formal. The
supper was not a feast so much as an occasion of friendly
and joyful converse, serving as a pleasant recognition of
Rebecca’s escape and recovery.
</p>

<p>
Marcius, whose enthusiasm for the new light which
so signally had come to him was unwearied, soon desired
to resume the discussion which they had begun
in the atrium.
</p>

<p>
<q>While I joy in the power of the truth that thrills me
through and through, there are certain things of which
I fain would make further inquiry,</q> said he to Serenus.
</p>

<p>
<q>I too would gladly receive further witness of the
truth,</q> said Rebecca.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold one is straitened to set forth the doctrine of
the Spirit in the language of men,</q> said Serenus. <q>It
is a hidden life, and being veiled, only can be made
<pb n="390"/><anchor id="Pg390"/>known through parables and symbols. It dwelleth in
the heart too deep for the persuasiveness of speech.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How unlike the learning of the schools!</q> said Marcius.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea; words and writings which concern the bodily
sensations of men, and the things that are without and
seen, are multiplied, while the things of the spirit are
silently digged out of the depths of the soul.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>After what manner was the teaching of the great
prophet of Nazareth?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Through symbols and parables! Nay, even more
through his life and example, and by means of the outward
signs, ministries, and miracles which witnessed
the divinity that was within him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have all men the same divinity?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>All in their real being are sons of God, but being
ignorant of their sonship, have not unfolded it into outward
manifestation. It is like a seed, containing life,
but not yet quickened into outward form and fruitfulness.
Man is only perfected as man, in the degree that he expresses
God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why are men so slow in their progress upward?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Chiefly because they think themselves to be bodies
rather than what they really are,—spirits having present
bodily articulation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In other words, thou wouldst say, that having only a
fleshly consciousness, they perform the works of the flesh,
ignorant of the spirit or real self which hath not yet
received a quickening.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou hast spoken it plainly. The works of the flesh
are mischievous, selfish, hateful, and corrupting, while
<pb n="391"/><anchor id="Pg391"/>those of the Spirit are peace, joy, love, and purity. So
long as men think themselves carnal in their being, the
corresponding works will follow. Every kind of thought
and belief bringeth forth a harvest of its own kind.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>If I rightly apprehend,</q> said Marcius, <q>thou dost
not set forth that the body is evil in itself?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay! the body, as the temple and expression of the
Spirit, is an holy building, sanctified and honorable.
But to be after that manner it must be man’s servant,
and not his master. It may render a delightful service,
or be a deadly tyrant! Shall the clay rule the potter?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Whence come its weaknesses and sicknesses?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>From the prevailing bodily consciousness which
giveth man the feeling that he must perish. He is
therefore filled with thoughts, fears, and beliefs of ill
which bring forth a universal fruitage of their own kind.
Man therefore bows himself in servitude to these, his
own creations, and ignorantly thinketh that they are
sent by God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How are they to be put away?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>By thinking upon the things that pertain to the
spiritual selfhood, and consciously ruling and harmonizing
the bodily instrument. The body is a living epistle,
setting forth the quality of the life, mind, and soul, of
which it is the visible result and correspondence. It is
the spoken word of the thought of man!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Wilt thou interpret to us a miracle?</q> said Rebecca,
who had followed every word of the conversation with
great interest.
</p>

<p>
<q>A miracle is a name which men give to any unwonted
demonstration of power which is above and
<pb n="392"/><anchor id="Pg392"/>beyond their common understanding. Miracles may be
wrought as signs of spiritual verity, or exercised in
works of love and mercy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do they require the special and direct intervention
of the one and supreme God of all the earth?</q> inquired
Marcius.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay; but rather an intelligent conformity to his wise
and unchanging laws, only the lower domain of which
is commonly understood.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We believe that thou canst perform works which to
the eyes of the world would seem miraculous!</q> said
Marcius with fulness of heart.
</p>

<p>
Rebecca’s eyes were moist with emotion, and her features
lighted up with grateful interest as she added,—
</p>

<p>
<q>I am persuaded that Serenus and Amabel can do
wonderful works! Of a surety many weeks would have
passed before my perfect healing had not their ministry
blessed me.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In proportion to the measure of faith and wisdom
which one can bring into exercise, he can perform the
works. They who make themselves fit channels for the
universal and abounding Life to flow through, will be
meet to minister effectually to the ills of the souls and
bodies of men. Until the time cometh when each can
fully work out his own salvation, it behooveth us to
strengthen the weak, raise the fallen, and heal the sick, as
we have opportunity. We must needs beware of thinking
any manner of evil, for ourselves or others, whether
pertaining to soul or body.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why hath not the New Faith spread more rapidly,
since it was proclaimed in its purity by the prophet of
<pb n="393"/><anchor id="Pg393"/>Nazareth?</q> said Marcius. <q>It would appear that such
a gospel would be received everywhere!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The world is not yet ready to discover the beauty
and power of a spiritual faith. Religion, to the Roman,
Greek, Hebrew, or barbarian, doth not signify a new and
richer life, but some system, ceremony, sacrifice, or oblation.
These have little moulding power, and have to do
with the outer rather than the inner man. Religions of
belief and tradition are many, but of the Spirit there is
but one.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Cometh not such systems from the darkened and vain
beliefs concerning God or the gods?</q> said Rebecca.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, verily! Both the Elohim and Yehovah of the
Hebrews, and the many gods of other nations, have been
invested with human passions, so that they must needs be
appeased or propitiated. Thence cometh the universal
dread and fear of an All-Powerful One, and the innumerable
expiations, atonements, rites, oblations, and libations,
so that peradventure some favors might be vouchsafed
by a Deity or deities whose ruling disposition is that of
anger. Men are not drawn by their fears, but through
their loves. As the Omnipresent Love—the true God—cometh
into recognition, the hearts of all will melt
into oneness with him, and the children of men be lifted
out of their fears, sorrows, sins, and sicknesses.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How plain; and yet how men are blinded to this
great principle!</q> said Marcius. <q>My former life seemeth
like a delusive dream, in that I have not before been
awakened to the truth. I see that as man’s concept of
God becometh purified, he is gradually transformed into
his image.</q>
</p>

<pb n="394"/><anchor id="Pg394"/>

<p>
<q>Thou hast well described the very corner-stone of
the divine life and perfection of man. To securely lay
this was the work of the Man of Galilee. But verily
the spirit of his advent hath been commonly darkened,
not only by his enemies, but by many of his avowed
followers.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How long, thinkest thou, O Serenus, will evil prevail
on the earth?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold no evil ruleth the earth, for that which so appeareth
is but the early, imperfect, and unripened Good.
Only the eye of the impure can behold the impure. God
is too pure to behold iniquity, for all things are working
out, in due time, the universal Perfection. To our dim
vision it seemeth slow, but time is but a sensuous limitation.
All things, whether in heaven, earth, or hades, are
working together, yea, are in travail, for the manifestation
of the sons of God.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is the teaching of the New Faith concerning
life beyond the grave?</q> inquired Rebecca.
</p>

<p>
<q>There is but one life, and man never enters the grave.
All the false traditions and beliefs concerning it have
come from the carnal or fleshly slavery into which men
have sold themselves. The earth taketh back to its
bosom the handful of dust which man hath gathered to
himself for a brief season. He tests his soul upon it,
and it outwardly marks his own and the general belief
touching it. We cast off coarse and worn-out garments
for those of finer and richer texture.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Dost thou believe that the more subtile or ethereal
body is already enclosed within the seen form?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am so persuaded. But in the fulness of time the
<pb n="395"/><anchor id="Pg395"/>grave will be closed, and man will walk forth in freedom.
Then will he gain such a spiritual consciousness
as to be able, little by little, to transmute and refine his
crude visibility into a finer and more enduring organism.
That which is called death then will have served its
purpose.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou hast made us glad by thy words of wisdom,</q>
said Rebecca. <q>We fain will let this light shine in the
darkness which surrounds us, dividing the word of Truth
discreetly among those who are open to receive it.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea,</q> said Marcius; <q>we can speak effectually through
our lives and deeds, and also by word of teaching wherever
there is an open door.</q>
</p>

<p>
The repast was concluded, and the guests separated.
</p>

<p>
<q>What an evening of gladness!</q> said Amabel. <q>Art
thou not pleased, dear Rebecca, that we were bidden?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have had unwonted joy and profit in the friendly
converse and warm hospitality. What a noble Roman
is Marcius! his whole heart seems filled with the New
Faith!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea,</q> said Serenus. <q>The seed of the Word hath
sprung up quickly within him because he was in readiness.
Men everywhere hunger for the simple bread of
life, but how often stones are set before them!</q>
</p>

<p>
Marcius retired to his cubiculum, but slumber refused
to be wooed by his eyelids. Whether in the light or
darkness, the pure, beautiful face of Rebecca stood out
before him. To him she was a saint,—a fitting embodiment
of a seraphic spirit in womanly form. His
mind was filled with a rushing procession of unwonted
thoughts,—
</p>

<pb n="396"/><anchor id="Pg396"/>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Blessed be the New Faith, which not only hath
healed the restlessness of my former state, but yielded
this vision of beauty! Blessed be Serenus! and blessed
above all be the God of all the earth!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Can she ever love me, who am but the remnant of a
wasted life? Nay, not so! Serenus says we have divinity
within us, and the destiny of sons of God! What
an inspiration! I knew not what I was, but now have
found myself!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Can I presume to win such a love as that of Rebecca?
Peradventure, it hath been bestowed upon one of her
own nation!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Behold the wonder of Tarsus should the Vice Legate
wed a Hebrew! A deposition from Cæsar! The contempt
of the city! I care not! My life I give to the
New Faith!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Again that vision of loveliness cometh over me!
Never before have I known love, but only its semblance!
Naught but the New Faith could reveal and interpret its
bliss!</q>
</p>

<p>
When Marcius finally resigned himself to the wooing
of Morpheus, his visions were paradisiacal, beatific,
elysian.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
A few evenings later Leander called his trusted slave
Metopus to his presence.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dost thou know well Colurus, a servitor in the palace
of Marcius?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have known him long, my lord!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thinkest thou that he regardeth gold?</q>
</p>

<pb n="397"/><anchor id="Pg397"/>

<p>
<q>I doubt it not, my lord! Its glitter dazzles his
eyes!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thy loyalty I know to be steadfast, Metopus. I have
a secret errand. Dost thou sometimes meet Colurus?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We shall meet to-night at the games. What wouldst
thou?</q>
</p>

<p>
Leander drew from beneath the fold of his tunic the
small shining phial containing the potion, and also a
purse of gold.
</p>

<p>
<q>I would have this potion administered to the Vice
Legate! It hath no taste nor smell, and may be mixed
in any of his drinks without suspicion.</q>
</p>

<p>
Metopus gave a knowing wink to his master.
</p>

<p>
<q>And will he fall down when he hath swallowed it?
Perchance our footprints could not be covered!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ha! thou sayest well, but I am no fool!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay, I have served thee too long not to know thy
wisdom!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Its power worketh very slowly, so that no consequence
can ever be discovered.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Not only a poet and an orator, my master, but a veritable
wonder-worker!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Spare thy applause for this time, Metopus! I say
to thee that a slow decline, which cometh only with
months and years, seemeth natural.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I understand.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Give the gold and the potion to Colurus, and swear,
by the visage of Apollo, that no harm will ever be traceable!
Nay, tell any story that seemeth expedient, for
thou art cunning!</q>
</p>

<p>
The plot was carried out in every detail.

<p>
Time rolled on. The disciples of the New Faith increased
in number, and ere long included the father and
mother of Rebecca. Their meetings were frequent, and
though held quietly, were without special secrecy. They
usually assembled at the rooms of Serenus, but sometimes
at the residence of Benoni.

</lg>
</epigraph>

<p>
The days and nights in the cave glided by rapidly and
serenely with Saulus and Amoz. The stillness of the
place, the beauty and grandeur of the mountains and
valleys, the companionship of wild animals and birds,
the luxuriance of verdure and blossom, and the sublime
view of the distant sea which the heights afforded,—all
were ministrant to soul-growth and inspiration. Much
time was also given to a reinterpretation of the law and
sacred writings of the prophets, copies of which had been
brought with them.
</p>

<p>
At intervals Saulus made short journeys to the shepherd
villages in the adjacent country, and as occasion
afforded began to teach and preach the New Faith to
such of the scattered herdsmen as were within reach.
This was but a light labor, and he counted his experience
as an easy school in the practice and power of the great
work of the future towards which he was already looking
with earnest anticipation. Only the consciousness
of a rapidly growing capacity to teach, and the favorable
<pb n="400"/><anchor id="Pg400"/>circumstances for the building up of an unwonted spiritual
energy and equipment, reconciled his intense and
untiring soul to a continuance of the sojourn in the
desert.
</p>

<p>
In the decision of Cassia, Saulus increasingly realized
that a weight had been lifted from the freedom and usefulness
of his future life, and although some yearnings
of heart were not easily stilled, his mastery over them
grew more complete. In the broader and more harmonious
disposition of soul which he now commanded, he
was astonished and humiliated as he looked back at
the wonderful charm which the untaught and impulsive
daughter of Almon formerly possessed for him. He
had left forever behind the fantasy and unregulated
passion which in time past raged within his soul, and
was now able to view life in its true and broadened
perspective.
</p>

<p>
In due time he received a letter from Rebecca which
warmed his heart. It ran as follows:—
</p>

<p><text><body>

<dateline rend="text-align: right"><date><hi rend="italic">Chisleu, XXIVth day.</hi></date></dateline>

<dateline rend="text-align: right">“<name><hi rend="smallcaps">House of Benoni, Tarsus.</hi></name></dateline>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">O my dear Saulus!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Peace, joy, and warm greetings to thee, my brother!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Thy letter from a cave of Horeb, in the wilderness
of Arabia, hath come to my hand, and it rejoiceth my
heart unspeakably!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">O Saulus! <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> a disciple of the New Faith! Do
not mine eyes deceive me? What a marvel hath God
wrought! Behold his loving mercy endureth forever!
The Spirit of Truth was in and around thee, and would
not be put away until it touched and melted thy heart.
<pb n="401"/><anchor id="Pg401"/>And the love of my soul also went with thee, even in thy
persecutions, and would not be satisfied until thou wast
awakened and didst come to thyself.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Behold I have such an abundance of good tidings
to give thee that of a surety my epistle will gladden
thy heart, even as thy message from the cave made us
rejoice greatly. Many unwonted events have come to
pass in our native city, some of which I will briefly
recount.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">When thou didst banish the noble Serenus from the
Holy City, Amabel, the daughter of Gamaliel, upon her
release, became his wife and fled with him, and returned
not to her father’s house. They journeyed to Cæsarea
and took ship for Tarsus, on the way to Rome, toward
which they had set their faces. The vessel was sunk in
the depths of the sea, but behold every soul on board
was saved and brought to Tarsus by the Vice Legate,
whose ship chanced to be near at hand. And now I
make known unto thee the most marvellous thing of all.
Through the faithful devotion and teaching of Serenus
and Amabel, both the Vice Legate and our father and
mother have become disciples of the New Faith. I am
persuaded that thy heart will leap for joy when these
tidings meet thine eyes! An iniquitous outbreak of persecution
in Tarsus, which seemed only evil, was blessed
in the ripening of this good harvest.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">On the day of a great festival in the temple and gardens
of Apollo, when the throng was great in the streets,
our people were cruelly set upon as they came from the
services of the synagogue. It arose from a lying rumor,
and came so swiftly that many of the Hebrews were
<pb n="402"/><anchor id="Pg402"/>wounded or faint from flight before they could reach
their habitations. Thus it chanced with our father and
mother, but before many days they were fully restored.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">The rabble sorely bruised and trampled upon my
body, and peradventure I should have perished, but in
my flight, Marcius, the Vice Legate, and Serenus saved
me from their hands. They brought me to the dwelling-place
of Amabel, which is connected with the Legate’s
palace. Through her ministration, with that of Serenus,
I was speedily healed.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Marcius is a noble Roman whose heart is warmed by
the New Faith, and his kindness to Serenus and Amabel,
and even to me, hath been continuous. The members
of the household of the higher life in Tarsus are
increasing in number, and all have much gladness in the
freedom of the Truth. Our gatherings for mutual converse,
encouragement, and communion with the Spirit
are often held at the house of our father Benoni, and the
Vice Legate hath been here with the others.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">The life and teaching of the great prophet of Nazareth
are faithfully set before us by Serenus, and faith,
love, and spiritual singleness are strengthened and multiplied.
Some who were sick have been healed, the
lame made to walk, evil spirits cast out, and the whole
gospel of salvation proclaimed to such as have ears to
hear. Outward signs and works of mercy give abundant
witness to the working of the power of God within.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">All have great joy in the letter which thou didst
send, and hope shortly that they may behold thy face
in thy native city.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Serenus sendeth his warm brotherly greetings, and
<pb n="403"/><anchor id="Pg403"/>our father and mother have great comfort in their hearts

<signed rend="text-align: right">“<hi rend="smallcaps">Rebecca.</hi>”</signed>
</body></text></p>

<p>
Tears of joy coursed down the cheeks of Saulus as
he finished reading the letter. He folded it to his
bosom, went out of the cave, and made his way up to
a frequented seat upon the heights.
</p>

<p>
The late afternoon sun, not too hot, softly gilded the
surrounding Sinaitic peaks, and kindled a golden radiance
upon the vast expanse of the distant Red Sea in
the west. Every tree, plant, blossom, and bird seemed
to be rejoicing in the rich, warm glow which bathed
heaven and earth with its beauty.
</p>

<p>
The objective world was the fitting symbol and correspondence
of the joy and fruition which flooded and
enlarged the soul of Saulus. The message from Rebecca
softened and melted the few hard vestiges of his former
state, and the tender greeting from Serenus caused a
great upheaval of love and thanksgiving. The dark
clouds of past memories were dissolved and scattered
by the warm sunshine from Tarsus.
</p>

<p>
To Saulus the light of God was within and without,
and each seemed but a varying aspect of one continuous
and many-sided Revelation. Man was the crown of
Nature, and in him its apex towered up until it touched
and became one with its Author. How shrunken,
mean, and unlovely the life of the past, which was now
dimmed and even overflowed by the privileges and possibilities
of the future which were unfolded before him.
</p>

<pb n="404"/><anchor id="Pg404"/>

<p>
A procession of months went by, and the time arrived
when Saulus, strengthened and confirmed in spirit and
power by his long retirement, was ready and eager to enter
again the busy world of men. Any hardship, or even
persecution, which he might meet would not discourage,
but rather stimulate, his activity. Like other great souls
who have recognized eternal principles, he knew that
the progress of Truth was hastened by opposition. To
encounter indifference would be far worse, but this could
not be. A man whose inner nature is at a white heat
must and will arouse antagonism. Error smarts when
revealed by the rays of Truth. There can be no truce.
Enthusiasm begets other enthusiasm, which may be either
for or against itself, but in its presence stagnation is
impossible. One earnest soul stored with the dynamics
of Faith will accomplish more than a thousand whose
spiritual outgoings are feeble and uncertain.
</p>

<p>
Saulus was deeply moved as he finally left the secluded
dwelling-place which had been hallowed by so
many profitable experiences, and the scene of so much
soul-growth. But the fulness of time had come, and
with Amoz he gladly set out upon the long journey.
After an uneventful crossing of the desert they reached
Damascus in due season.
</p>

<p>
Making their way to the house of Ananias, they were
hospitably received. Saulus lost no time in visiting
the synagogues, and immediately began to preach the
higher life in spiritual simplicity as it had been proclaimed
by Jesus.
</p>

<p>
The Jewish Hellenists and proselytes were numerous
in Damascus, and up to the time of the arrival of
<pb n="405"/><anchor id="Pg405"/>Saulus, the liberal party, including those who had nominally
accepted the New Faith, lived in mutual toleration
with the bigoted school of the <foreign rend="italic">Halacha</foreign>, which was
much more powerful. But now the dry bones were
shaken. Soon the burning and unanswerable arguments
of Saulus awoke a storm of angry opposition. The
slumber in dead forms was rudely ended, and fierce
persecution began.
</p>

<p>
Ananias and the little band of liberal Jews found
themselves utterly unable to quiet the storm which this
dangerous intruder aroused. It was as if Stephanos
had arisen and come back to shatter the self-sufficiency
and deadness of ceremonialism, and now, as in his time,
religious intolerance burst aflame.
</p>

<p>
The life of Saulus was demanded. The Ethnarch of
the city, who commanded the garrison, being in sympathy
with the persecution, lent his aid to the conspiracy to
end the career of the over-zealous young heretic. The
gates of the city were watched night and day to prevent
his escape. Was his work to be brought to a close
before it had fairly begun?
</p>

<p>
Not another day must pass or it would be too late
to save him. There was a hurried consultation of his
friends. Happy thought! the house of one of them
abutted upon the city wall! The plot may yet be frustrated!
He is secretly conducted to this house in the
evening. The night is dark, and the sentry passes but
infrequently! A little knot of faithful friends with anxious
hearts are on the watch! A large basket held by a
strong rope hangs out of the window over the wall. All
is still, and Saulus steps in. The sentry goes by, and
<pb n="406"/><anchor id="Pg406"/>now strong hands lower the basket, down, down, carefully
but swiftly. It reaches the ground!
</p>

<p>
By previous understanding Amoz is not far away, and
arm in arm they go out into the darkness. Surely an
ignominious beginning!
</p>

<p>
One warm afternoon a few weeks later Saulus and
Amoz approached the Damascus Gate of the Holy City.
Though hot and weary from their journey, as they came
near its end they were imbued with new life and courage.
</p>

<p>
In many of the towns and villages through which they
had come Saulus discoursed in the synagogues, but made
no lengthy sojourn, as he was anxious to reach Jerusalem
and confer with Peter, Barnabas, and other disciples
of the New Faith.
</p>

<p>
As they entered the well-remembered portal, Saulus
was reminded of the brilliant cavalcade at the head of
which he formerly passed out, as compared with his unheralded
return on foot with but one of his many companions.
But despite the contrast, a great flood of
thankfulness filled his heart.
</p>

<p>
A multitude of strange thoughts crowded upon him as
his eyes rested again upon familiar places and scenes.
Should he show his face boldly, or for a while avoid his
old friends and companions?
</p>

<p>
What of Cassia and the household of Almon, his comrades
of the <foreign rend="italic">Urim</foreign>, the Rabban, and the Sanhedrin?
</p>

<p>
Here was the Lyceum, where he had hotly contended
for the hard dogmas of the Jewish law; here the many
places where he had scourged men, women, and children;
and here the prison whose cruel doors, at his command,
had closed upon Serenus, Amabel, and the rest of the
<pb n="407"/><anchor id="Pg407"/>congregation of the Upper Chamber. He felt like a
stranger from some far country, and the past flitted before
him as a dark and terrible dream from which he
had newly awakened.
</p>

<p>
Somewhat changed in appearance and costume, he
passed through several streets unrecognized, finally turning
into the courtyard of a dwelling where he had been
told in Damascus he would find Peter and Barnabas.
Amoz, after an affectionate farewell, left him to seek
some of his own kinsfolk who dwelt in another part of
the city.
</p>

<p>
In response to a knock at the door of the house of
Peter, it was opened by a maid, who when she saw his
face uttered a loud cry, and shrank back affrighted into
the house. Then Peter’s wife came quickly to see what
had happened. She too looked upon the well-remembered
features, exclaiming with great fear and agitation,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou art Saulus! Hast thou returned to take us to
prison?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay, I bring peace to this house! I am no more a
persecutor, but of the New Faith! I pray thee, is Peter
within?</q>
</p>

<p>
Peter’s wife suspected craftiness, and did not believe
him, but stood trembling, not knowing how to make
reply.
</p>

<p>
<q>Peter is not within!</q> said she after some hesitation.
</p>

<p>
<q>I might have expected that all would flee from me!</q>
said Saulus, half to himself. <q>A righteous retribution!</q>
Then, continuing in an earnest and friendly tone, he
said,—
</p>

<pb n="408"/><anchor id="Pg408"/>

<p>
<q>Of a surety I am now a follower of the Nazarene!</q>
</p>

<p>
Peter’s wife still hesitated, not knowing what to believe,
and Saulus turned sorrowfully away, saying,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell Peter that I love the brethren! I will come
again after his return.</q>
</p>

<p>
The maid had escaped from the house, and quickly
warned the faithful who lived in the neighborhood.
Many fled from their homes, taking their children with
them, believing that, as Saulus had returned, a new persecution
was at hand. Consternation reigned, and word
was sent out among the disciples in other parts of the
city that they were again to be harassed and hunted
down.
</p>

<p>
Saulus was sorely grieved when he left the house of
Peter. He was counted an enemy among his friends.
He almost wished himself back in the desert.
</p>

<p>
It was now evening, and not expedient to visit Peter’s
house before the morrow. He walked aimlessly along
the street hardly knowing what to do, but being weary,
and seeing a small inn near by, entered, thinking to sojourn
for the night. After removing the dust and sweat
of the journey, and partaking of a light supper, he
walked out to enjoy the cool of the evening, and calm
his troubled thoughts. The moon was bright, the air
soft, the streets crowded, and the sound of voices and
laughter echoed from the house-tops.
</p>

<p>
What a contrast with the desert and cave! What a
great network, and even tangle, of disagreeing interests,
systems, opinions, and religions! How sorely the world
needed the resolving and transforming power of the
new life, and a knowledge of the higher law!
Selfish<pb n="409"/><anchor id="Pg409"/>ness, prejudice, sensuality, and devotion to the seen and
temporal, everywhere dominant! What a change in himself,
and in his interpretation of life!
</p>

<p>
As these reflections coursed through his mind, he
found himself at the entrance of one of the public gardens
which skirted the slope of Mount Moriah. The
spicy odor of plant and blossom lent a charm to the
place, and being in a meditative mood, he entered and
seated himself in a retired corner of one of the bowers.
Groups of people were all around, some seated and
others promenading, seeking the enjoyment of social
converse and recreation. Occasional peals of laughter
and snatches of song gave evidence of the light-heartedness
of the children of the Orient.
</p>

<p>
But Saulus was wrapped in a more profound revery.
With a heart full of love he had come to bear a great
blessing to the Holy City, but none would receive it.
To his old friends he was now a renegade and traitor,
while to his new brethren he was a terror and a cause
of offence. O ungrateful world! With head bowed
between his hands, the hot tears could not be held
back.
</p>

<p>
A young man and woman from among the promenaders
sat down near him. Although they were hard by,
a partial partition of vines intervened, effectually secluding
him. He started to arise, but could not retreat
without passing directly before them in the full moonlight
to the entrance of the bower. Moreover, the conversation
could not concern him, so he kept his seat.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou seemest sad, and not like thyself to-night, my
Cassia!</q>
</p>

<pb n="410"/><anchor id="Pg410"/>

<p>
Saulus was thunderstruck. But to fly would be to
reveal his identity.
</p>

<p>
There was no response. The voice continued,—
</p>

<p>
<q>The last full moon witnessed our marriage feast, and
behold the light of this revealeth thy sadness!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Peradventure thou judgest not rightly, Ezra!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why, then, hast thou become silent? I hear no
more thy wonted cheerful converse! thou art downcast!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>To-night I am given to meditation!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Have I given thee offence?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have made no complaint!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But why so unhappy, Cassia? Dost thou not love
thy husband?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, question me not! I feel strangely to-night!</q>
she exclaimed rather petulantly.
</p>

<p>
<q>Have I done aught to offend thee?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have no condemnation!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As thy husband, I rightfully claim to know why thou
art disquieted.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I cannot reveal my thoughts! Let me be silent!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou dost set thy face against me, Cassia!</q> he exclaimed
with some earnestness.
</p>

<p>
<q>Rebuke me not, I pray thee! If I am disconsolate,
it lieth not within me to be otherwise!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why didst thou become my wife, if my presence is
disquieting?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have made no such accusation!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Aha!</q> he exclaimed bitterly. <q>I am persuaded that
thy thoughts turn towards thy former lover, Saulus!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>For shame, Ezra! thou speakest foolishness!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou canst not deny it!</q>

<p>
<q>Thou art cruel, and dost not love me!</q> The tone
was that of impatient reproach.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou hast deceived me! I am persuaded that there
is love in thy heart for Saulus! Thou declared unto
me that thou didst hold him in contempt!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou knowest not to the contrary!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou hast betrayed thyself, Cassia! I would that
thou hadst given thyself to the mad heretic, and that
mine eyes had never beheld thy comely but false face!</q>
</p>

<p>
Frantic weeping, moans, and flighty laughter gave evidence
that Cassia had suddenly become moonstruck or
hysterical.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Saulus! why did I scorn thee? O Saulus! Saulus!
I seem to feel thy presence—near—me—even—now!
O Saulus! Saulus!</q>

<head>CHAPTER XXXII<lb/>SCOURGING AND FLIGHT</head>

<p>
On the following morning Saulus was up betimes,
after a restless night, which was marked by dreams and
visions of varying import.
</p>

<p>
It would be unreasonable to expect that as yet he
was able to put under foot all adversities, and continually
dwell upon the heights of a spiritual consciousness.
Even in a great and lofty soul, Adam dies hard,
and in an intense nature he fights desperately for his
life, and has many apparent resurrections. Spiritual
evolution has its ebb and flow, and except from a broad
point of view its declensions often appear to be enduring.
As with material structures, if the work projected
is to reach beyond the hidden foundation, it must needs
wait until the latter is broadened.
</p>

<p>
While Saulus had a good measure of the same spirit
which filled the great Prophet of Nazareth, he also had an
earnest desire during his stay in the Holy City to learn
more of the particulars of the Master’s outward life.
</p>

<p>
At the rising of the sun he set out for Golgotha. He
fain would stand upon the spot of the great Martyrdom.
Even the hallowed ground, with its associations,
would be a means of inspiration to one like Saulus. As
he reached the skull-shaped hill, the sun was shining
<pb n="413"/><anchor id="Pg413"/>brightly, the air clear and soft, and the whole scene
quiet and peaceful. He felt a benediction!
</p>

<p>
How much the great Tragedy that was here consummated
signifies to the world! How the outgoing circles
of spiritual life and love ever pulsate from this centre!
No nation is too remote to be washed and beat upon
by its outgoing waves, for a divine discontent never permits
of stagnation!
</p>

<p>
Golgotha, or the hill of Calvary, was a peculiarly
sacred place to the disciples, and they often resorted
to its summit for converse and meditation.
</p>

<p>
As Saulus lingered, busy with the thoughts of the
past and questions of the future, a man, apparently having
the same purpose, came near. Lo, it was Barnabas!
</p>

<p>
They beheld each other, face to face, and surprise
was pictured upon the features of both.
</p>

<p>
<q>And <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> here, Saulus!</q> said Barnabas, involuntarily
drawing back with trepidation.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Barnabas, hear me! I love thee and all the brethren!</q>
Stepping forward, he embraced his old friend,
saluting him warmly.
</p>

<p>
<q><hi rend="italic">Saulus</hi> numbered among the disciples!</q> said Barnabas,
putting his hands upon his shoulders and earnestly
looking into his face, still hardly able to believe the
truth.
</p>

<p>
<q>As I live,</q> said Saulus, <q>my heart hath been warmed
by the New Faith! Oh, receive my testimony!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I doubt no more, and rejoice in thy behalf. Accept
a brother’s welcome!</q>
</p>

<p>
Falling on each other’s necks, they had great joy in
a fellowship of faith and love.
</p>

<pb n="414"/><anchor id="Pg414"/>

<p>
After a season of delightful converse, they started, arm
in arm, for the city. Barnabas gladly went with Saulus
to the house of Peter, and set him and the other disciples
aright concerning their former persecutor.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou sayest,</q> said Saulus, <q>that the churches have
peace, and are edified, and walk in the comfort of the
Spirit! Hath the Sanhedrin ceased all persecution
against them?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of late it seemeth to have given little heed to us,
so we have in no wise been disquieted. They have
not hindered us from teaching that Jesus was indeed
a great Prophet.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How is it that their bitterness hath been put away?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Peradventure that Gamaliel and other of the liberal
Jews counselled that we be let alone until our doctrine
came to naught, and also because the disciples in great
measure have returned to a conformity to the wonted
ordinances and ceremonies.</q>
</p>

<p>
A shadow passed over the face of Saulus.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dost thou not count such a conformity as a fellowship
with dead works? I am minded that the gospel
should be separate, and that the household of the New
Faith should be counted no longer as a Jewish sect!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It hath seemed expedient to some that for the present
the ordinances be continued for the sake of peace,
but verily I am persuaded that our spiritual life hath
been deadened thereby, and its power diminished. Now
that thou art here to cast in thy lot with us, our zeal may
be warmed, and we receive a quickening.</q>
</p>

<p>
It seems probable that the Sanhedrin had come to regard
the church of Peter, James, and John as but one
<pb n="415"/><anchor id="Pg415"/>more sect added to the complex Jewish economy, which
was willing to continue the established ritual. But in
the movement of Jesus, and afterward of Stephanos and
Saulus, it discerned a disturbing and vital force which
in due time would logically supplant Judaism through
the establishment of a religion radically different.
</p>

<p>
It was not difficult for Barnabas to reconcile the disciples
to Saulus, for not only was his sincerity manifest,
but his earnest aggressiveness in their behalf was bold
and untiring.
</p>

<p>
The law of specific gravity among souls is no less invariable
and operative than with fluids and solids. If a
born commander be placed in the ranks of the private,
he will not remain, for all the laws of the universe conspire
to lift him into his fitting niche. The moral and
spiritual dynamics of a great soul can no more stay
pent up than the forces that stir a volcano into activity.
The advent of Saulus into the Holy City ended all indifference
and stagnation, and soon the various elements
were glowing at a white heat.
</p>

<p>
But a few days elapsed after his arrival before he began
teaching and preaching in the synagogues. Among
all the enemies who sprung up to oppose his work and
persecute him, none were more bitter and unrelenting
than his former comrades of the <foreign rend="italic">Urim</foreign>. These were the
same who once had glorified him beyond measure.
</p>

<p>
The dignified Sanhedrin for the time was disposed to
close its official ears to the work of their former agent
and instrument, doubtless having in mind their moral
discomfiture at the trial of Stephanos. They thought it
more politic to leave the rabble to deal with him through
<pb n="416"/><anchor id="Pg416"/>some sudden outbreak than to take formal cognizance of
his heresies through the procedure of a regular trial.
</p>

<p>
Saulus boldly entered into the synagogues of the
Hellenists, and eloquently commended the New Faith,
contrasting its power and beauty with the traditions,
ordinances, and dead works of the Temple service.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon at a meeting in the synagogue of the
Cyrenians, Saulus essayed to make an address according
to previous announcement. It was in the same room
where Stephanos had spoken with such zeal, and from
which he had been dragged to trial and condemned.
</p>

<p>
Upon this occasion the enemies of Saulus gathered in
strength, the members of the <foreign rend="italic">Urim</foreign>, by secret understanding
occupying the front seats, thoroughly organized for
offensive action. He had been warned of trouble by the
more prudent of his friends, but would not consent to
abate one jot of his stirring presentation of the new
gospel, and the contrasting hollowness of the whole ceremonial
system.
</p>

<p>
For a full hour before the opening of the service the
synagogue was crowded, and a dense throng gathered
outside. At length the exercises began. Saulus arose
to speak, but had hardly uttered a sentence before there
was such a tumult that his voice could not be heard. He
beckoned for silence, but the uproar continued. At
length he picked up a roll of the law to read from the
prophets, and the gathering, willing to show some respect
to their Scriptures, was quieted. He read the following
passages from Isaiah:—
</p>

<p rend="display">
<q rend="post: none"><q>To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto
me? saith the Lord: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams,
<pb n="417"/><anchor id="Pg417"/>and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of
bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.... Your new moons
and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble
unto me; I am weary to bear them. And when ye spread
forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when
ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of
blood. Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your
doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; learn to do
well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless,
plead for the widow.... He was oppressed, yet he humbled
himself, and opened not his mouth; as a lamb that is led to the
slaughter, and as a sheep that before her shearers is dumb;
yea, he opened not his mouth.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold what the Lord saith through the lips of
Isaiah concerning sacrifices, and burnt offerings of rams,
and the blood of lambs and he-goats! The voice of the
prophet bringeth judgment and condemnation to this generation!
Wash you, and make yourselves clean through
the gospel of the New Faith! Again, behold what Isaiah
saith concerning the Messias who should arise in the
fulness of time! <q>By oppression and judgment he was
taken away, but there was no deceit in his mouth.</q>
Behold its fulfilment in the Nazarene!</q>
</p>

<p>
Laughing scornfully, they cried out,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Cursed be thy mouth! The Nazarene was an impostor,
and no Messias!</q>
</p>

<p>
Listening no longer, they rushed madly forward, and
dragged him from the reading-desk.
</p>

<p>
<q>The scourge! the scourge! the scourge!</q> shouted
angry voices from all parts of the synagogue.
</p>

<p>
Looking steadfastly into the malignant faces which
<pb n="418"/><anchor id="Pg418"/>surrounded him, a mingled expression of dignity, compassion,
and contempt was upon his countenance. The
spiritual exaltation of his soul so overshadowed his bodily
consciousness that he felt no fear, and neither he nor his
friends offered any resistance to the howling mob which
threatened him.
</p>

<p>
It was one of those upheavals with which history is
crowded, which have taken place among nearly all races
and religions. There is no crime nor indignity that has
not again and again been committed by religious bigotry
gilded by assumed dutiful consecration.
</p>

<p>
Their decision was spontaneous, and Saulus was taken
away without legal formality or deliberation. Through
the irony of fate, he was led outside the gates to the
same spot where Stephanos had been stoned under his
own supervision.
</p>

<p>
Tying both of his hands to a column, they proceeded
as was usual in cases of punishment by the scourge. The
leaders tore down his robe until his breast and shoulders
were laid bare, then the <foreign rend="italic">Chazzan</foreign> of the synagogue, as was
customary, was selected to administer the flagellation.
The scourge was composed of two thongs of ass’s hide
which passed through a hole in the handle. Standing
on a block of stone behind the prisoner, the executioner
wielded the blows with all the force of one hand, thirteen
times on the breast, and thirteen back of each shoulder—in
all, forty, save one.
</p>

<p>
Although there had been no formal trial and condemnation,
the usual custom in cases of scourging was followed.
Three judges were chosen,—one reading the
prescribed passages from the law while the punishment
<pb n="419"/><anchor id="Pg419"/>was being inflicted, the second numbering the blows, the
third giving the order before each blow, <q><foreign rend="italic">Hakkehu</foreign></q>
(strike him). Even in the methods of a mob the slavish
literalism and ingrained devotion to traditional detail were
not lacking.
</p>

<p>
Though the scourging was given in full measure, Saulus
was not greatly overcome. Before the first blow fell he
passed into such a spiritual ecstasy that little consciousness
of the body or of painful sensation was manifest.
</p>

<p>
Among a little group of women who gathered to witness
the punishment was Cassia, who as the blows fell
had alternations of hysterical weeping and laughter.
She insisted upon being present, and could not be dissuaded.
The most opposite emotions possessed her.
After the scourging, but before Saulus was led away, a
look of recognition passed between them.
</p>

<p>
He was silent!
</p>

<p>
<q>The stripes were well laid on, and thou hast thy
just reward!</q> she cried with a loud, scornful voice; then,
bursting, into tears and groans, she was led away by
her friends. Hatred and love, burning in their severity,
struggled within her for mastery, but the former was
victorious.
</p>

<p>
Saulus rapidly recovered from his punishment, and
utterly undaunted by his experience, again began preaching
and teaching. But the brethren became apprehensive
for his life, and also feared that another general
persecution might begin. Though holding his power
and zeal in great respect, they advised his immediate
retirement from the Holy City. But he was reluctant
to follow their counsel. Soon a well-matured plot among
<pb n="420"/><anchor id="Pg420"/>the members of the <foreign rend="italic">Urim</foreign> came to the knowledge of the
brethren, and they yet more strongly urged his flight.
But as it seemed like an abandonment of his long-cherished
plans, and a dishonor to the cause which was so
all important, he still lingered.
</p>

<p>
On the day before a whispered conspiracy was to have
been consummated, Saulus retired to a quiet place for
spiritual communion and guidance. He had trusted the
inner Voice before, and been led aright, why not in the
present strait? The intensity of his desire and emotion
ended in a vision.<note place="foot"><p>The Biblical account of this transaction (Acts xxii. 17-21) is brief and
natural, and there is no claim or indication that the trance was peculiar or
miraculous. Paul, in his visions, guidances, and miracles, never assumed to
be more than human, or unlike other imperfect men, in his experiences.
</p>

<p>
Has anything done greater harm to the Bible than the glamour that has
been put upon it, and the distance which has been assumed between the
events therein related and those which are common to all mankind? The
laws which govern the psychical, moral, and spiritual experiences of men are
uniform and unchangeable. Otherwise the whole higher economy is chaotic
and unreliable.
</p>

<p>
If an exalted vision of the Divine, a guidance from the inner Spirit of
Truth, a miracle of healing, or an interview with one who has passed into the
Unseen—one or all of these—is possible in one age, then, under <hi rend="italic">like conditions</hi>,
it is possible for all time. If the Bible were brought near and humanized,
it would become clear, practical, and harmonious. Its teachings
and history would be spiritually natural and evolutionary. The grandest
work of the present time is its rescue from the literalism, strangeness, and
dehumanization with which it has been burdened. It is thereby honored
and made congruous. The multitude of warring sects has come from its
literalization. It is a natural and simple record of the experiences of men
of varying condition, some of whom were spiritually developed in eminent
degree. It is inspired because it inspires.</p></note> He entered into a state where
a broadened outlook of condition, duty, and privilege
was opened before him. The dark curtain which made
the future obscure and perplexing was parted, and a
highway, leading forward, illumined and made plain.
</p>

<pb n="421"/><anchor id="Pg421"/>

<p>
The inner Voice said,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Depart, for I will send thee forth afar unto the
Gentiles!</q>
</p>

<p>
History is ever repeating itself. Persecution of the
Truth scatters its seed and multiplies its influence.
</p>

<p>
Saulus hastily escaped from Jerusalem, being conducted
by his brethren as far as Cæsarea on his way
to Tarsus.

<head>CHAPTER XXXIII<lb/>A PRIESTESS OF THE TARSIAN TEMPLE</head>

<epigraph><lg>
<l>“How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame</l>
<l>Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,</l>
<l>Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!</l>
<l>O, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!”</l>
</lg>
</epigraph>
<p>
A day of extreme heat was closing in Tarsus. The
heavens were like burnished brass, and the sultry air
glowed as if newly discharged from the mouth of a furnace.
The sun had dropped behind a heavy mass of
leaden clouds, tinged with crimson, which hung ominously
over the distant range of the western Taurus,
though the horizon above the city was still clear. The
torrid radiation from the dark paving-stones had arisen
in quivering waves every hour of the long day, and penetrated
alike palace and hut.
</p>

<p>
Marcius was seated in his private library in an absorbed
though somewhat restless temper of mind. There
are times when the soul is lifted out of the petty routine
of every-day living, and thus loosened from present
environment, it soars abroad among scenes and
recognitions long past, or, anon, essays to penetrate the
veil of the future. During such seasons the human
spirit transcends its ordinary limitations, and is uplifted
by aspirations and experiences which are beyond
the realm of cold logic and materialistic science.
</p>

<pb n="423"/><anchor id="Pg423"/>

<p>
Of late one portentous augury of bygone days lingered
in the mind of Marcius with untiring persistency. It
was but a brief deliverance, yet it stood before him in
letters of fire. He had often thought it trivial, and dismissed
it from recollection, but as often it returned, refusing
to be barred out. Was it a prophetic curse? or
only a simple warning which already had been heeded
and its occasion atoned for?
</p>

<p>
This evening the problem came upon him afresh, and
the fateful words fairly rung in his ears,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou art incapable of love, and it shall remain unknown
to thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
How vividly that strange scene of the past flashed
before him! The mysterious <foreign rend="italic">adytum</foreign> of the Temple;
the clammy, crawling vapor; the uncanny Shapes; the
ghostly but beautiful Alethea, and her divination of
the future!
</p>

<p>
He thought lightly of its interpretation when uttered—now
it weighed him down.
</p>

<p>
His love for Rebecca had become a consuming flame,
but it was a white flame, unmingled with smoke. Day
by day every passing breeze fanned it. In her the
transparent beauty of the New Faith blossomed into
visible illustration and embodiment.
</p>

<p>
Marcius had not yet made an avowal of his love, for
he consciously shrank from breaking in upon the secrecy
of the inner adoration of his own soul. If she felt no
response, a declaration would only rudely disturb the
symmetry of his beautiful dream, and if perchance there
was a reciprocal glow, the delightful mystery, like a
sealed fragrance, would keep. In social relation with
<pb n="424"/><anchor id="Pg424"/>him she was natural and friendly, but anything beyond
was an enigma.
</p>

<p>
But again the direful words of Alethea, like the muttering
of the now distant thunder, reverberated through
his soul, and disturbed his dream of bliss. Was he forever
doomed to be a stranger to a rounded and reciprocated
love? Might not Alethea now relent, and dissolve
her seeming curse, and grant a blessing instead? Can
it be that human jealousy invades the realm of the
Unseen?
</p>

<p>
Could he not, peradventure, again invoke the fair
Alethea, and while beseeching her own forgiveness for
the past, implore her blessing for the future?
</p>

<p>
The threatened storm gathered and burst with great
force upon the city. Rain, and at intervals hail, beat
upon the walls and roofs of houses, and cooled the hot
flagstones in the streets. Forked lightning rent the
clouds, and thunder caused the very foundations of the
city to tremble.
</p>

<p>
Since Marcius espoused the New Faith he had discontinued
visits to the Temple of Apollo. But now he
strongly desired to meet Alethea. Would she again appear
to him if he sought her in the same place? Her
condemnation <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be lifted, her forgiveness obtained,
and her benediction implored!
</p>

<p>
The roar of the storm continued with little abatement.
What a favorable time to go unattended and incognito!
The desire strengthened into immediate purpose. Disregarding
the tempest, he ordered a trusted servitor to
bring his favorite horse, and hastily disguising himself,
mounted, and rode rapidly toward the Temple.
</p>

<pb n="425"/><anchor id="Pg425"/>

<p>
Upon entering he found the <foreign rend="italic"><anchor id="corr425"/><corr sic="proanos">pronaos</corr></foreign> deserted, and but
a few scattered devotees in the <foreign rend="italic">cella</foreign>. Throwing off his
outside garment, he seated himself for a little time to
command his thoughts before penetrating into the <foreign rend="italic">adytum</foreign>.
The perpetual sacred fire on the great hearth sent
its fitful gleams upon the symbols and hieroglyphs which
thickly covered the walls and ceilings. As he sat and
watched them they seemed to fade, dissolve, and reappear
in capricious succession, inspiring a sense of the presence
of invisible enchantments. The harps of Æolia,
which hung in the openings of the outer walls, groaned
and shrieked a chaotic <foreign rend="italic">Miserere</foreign>, as if a great chorus of
condemned spirits were disquieted by the force of the
angry tempest without.
</p>

<p>
At length the signal was given, and Marcius passed
through the valve, and following for some distance a
dim, winding, and descending corridor, at length entered
the <foreign rend="italic">adytum</foreign>. As aforetime, the flaming symbol of the
<foreign rend="italic">Mysteria Eleusinia</foreign> flashed upon him, and then slowly
faded into a ghastly vaporous obscurity. Farther on
faint flashes of blue light shot up from deeps which
seemed bottomless.
</p>

<p>
Marcius silently waited for a brief period, hoping that
Alethea would again appear, but was disappointed.
There was no sound save distant echoes of discordant
voices, now seeming to be above, and anon issuing from
the pit below.
</p>

<p>
Presently, wearied of waiting, he called aloud,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Alethea! I would see Alethea!</q>
</p>

<p>
Mocking sepulchral reverberations of his words were
the only response.
</p>

<pb n="426"/><anchor id="Pg426"/>

<p>
Again pouring out his request with a like result, his
wonted composure was considerably shaken.
</p>

<p>
With growing disappointment he was about to make
one louder call before leaving, when at his right hand
an unseen valve suddenly opened, revealing a narrow
private stairway hitherto unknown to him, leading from
some of the many apartments of the great Temple above.
A moment more, and footsteps, light but very real, were
heard coming down.
</p>

<p>
A female form of enchanting beauty gracefully entered,
and stood before him. Her eyes of a deep liquid blue
turned towards him, her silken, blond tresses fell artlessly
backward, and her features were of such loveliness
as rarely comes in human mould. A white, flowing robe
of exquisite softness and gauzelike lightness enveloped
her form, leaving her shapely neck and shoulders fully
exposed. A delicate fragrance of wild rose was borne in
upon the atmosphere with her. There she stood, slender,
lithe, symmetrical, radiant.
</p>

<p>
Marcius was startled.
</p>

<p>
She was neither Alethea, nor any other spirit.
</p>

<p>
<q>Who art thou? and why didst thou appear when I
called for another?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>This is the night for mortals, and not for spirits!</q>
she replied sweetly. <q>I am one of the priestesses of
the Temple, and they call me the <q>Chosen One.</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is thy mission here?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold thou didst vainly call for some one, and I
have come to charm away thy disappointment, give thee
solace, and keep thee company.</q>
</p>

<p>
She smiled.
</p>

<pb n="427"/><anchor id="Pg427"/>

<p>
Marcius retreated for a step, but his gaze was fastened
upon her.
</p>

<p>
<q>Peradventure thou dost count me for a shade who
hath momentarily put on the form!</q> she said archly.
<q>But no! I am very real flesh and blood!</q>
</p>

<p>
Then she lightly touched her hand to one of his own
convincingly.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am well persuaded that thou hast never crossed the
Styx; but I came hither especially to see another, who
dwelleth beyond.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The signs to-night forbid!</q> she replied with an intelligence
that seemed to be official. <q>Four nights of
each week the mystical curtain which veils the Unseen
is parted, but this is not one of them.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will come again,</q> Marcius replied in a low voice,
beginning to turn away.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hasten not! Perchance thy discomfiture and loneliness
may be soothed. Doth not the dominion of Eros
cover the earth as well as the realm of spirit? Nay,
doth not the universe bow to his mastery? Even the
stars of heaven woo each other by their attractiveness,
and flash forth their kisses in beams of light, and the
cohesion of atoms is but the warm embrace of an universal
enchantment!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I cannot listen to thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But thou art listening! Surely thou dost not despise
the worship of the Temple and her gods, else thou art
not a loyal Tarsian! None are dead to love, and both
great and small do her honor!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I close my ears to thy beguilement!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I would not beguile thee, but thou art heartless,
<pb n="428"/><anchor id="Pg428"/>and withal cold in thy devotion to our sacred divinities!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thy words are wasted, and touch me not!</q>
</p>

<p>
She came nearer, placing her hand upon her heart, and
looking into his eyes, said,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold the roar of the storm without, while the
blissful shrine in my sanctuary above, where I alone
reign as priestess, invites a united homage!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I bid thee farewell, and will brave the storm!</q>
</p>

<p>
The beautiful features of the priestess suddenly froze
into an expression of scorn and contempt, as she swept
quickly out of sight, and the valve slammed behind her.
</p>

<p>
Turning again to depart, Marcius had advanced but a
step when strains of heavenly music floated in from the
farther end of the cavern. He lingered entranced, while
the harmony swelled and diminished with an unearthly
sweetness which bound him to the spot.
</p>

<p>
Anon a great volume of dense vapor poured up from
below, lifting itself by a graceful spiral motion, and
gaining steadily in density!
</p>

<p>
Was Alethea yet to appear?
</p>

<p>
No!
</p>

<p>
Yes!
</p>

<p>
See!
</p>

<p>
It gathers itself into a defined form! It emerges from
its soft background and comes forward!
</p>

<p>
<q>Alethea!</q>
</p>

<p>
Her bosom heaves with seeming life, and her eyes
glisten with emotion.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Alethea! I have come this time to implore thy
forgiveness and seek thy blessing!</q>
</p>

<pb n="429"/><anchor id="Pg429"/>

<p>
<q>Marcius! I have beheld thy new life from the free
domain of the Unseen, and also stood by thy side this
night! Here jealousy hath no place! Thy past is
freely forgiven, and my blessing, and that of Heaven,
will rest upon thee—<hi rend="italic">and Rebecca</hi>. Until the earth-life
is closed—farewell!</q>
</p>

<p>
The form slowly dissolved, and Marcius left the
Temple, and passed out into the storm.

<q>Rivers are highways that move on, and bear us whither we wish

</p>
</epigraph>

<p>
A few days after the evening excursion of Marcius to
the Temple, a little party emerged from the house of
Benoni into the spacious grounds which overlooked the
Cydnus. It was soon after mid-day. Though the sun
shone brightly, a refreshing breeze down the valley from
the Taurus mountains made the afternoon balmy and
delightful. The cool waters of the river hurried quietly
past, while the sunshine caused the ripple which danced
upon its surface to gleam like molten gold.
</p>

<p>
The river barge of Marcius, called the Felicia, well
manned by stalwart oarsmen, waiting at Benoni’s landing
by the foot of the terraces, presaged an excursion. The
group lingered a little, and loitered through the grounds
to enjoy the clusters of spice-trees, roses, oleanders, and
jasmine which bordered the winding paths that sloped
to the water’s edge.
</p>

<p>
Looking up the river, the thick fringes of shrubs and
trees which lined its banks could be followed by the eye,
capriciously zigzag in their course, narrowing in the dim
distance almost to a thread when traced toward the mountain
wall of the northern horizon. The distant lofty
<pb n="431"/><anchor id="Pg431"/>range stood out in calm, serene beauty, its summits softened
by light scattered foliage, and kissed by the rays
of the afternoon sun.
</p>

<p>
The band of the New Faith in Tarsus had added many
to its numbers through the labors of Serenus. Seconded
by Amabel, and aided by Benoni, Rebecca, and Marcius,
he was untiring in his work to kindle the higher life in
the souls who were willing to listen, and the synagogue
soon became divided between those who were bound by
dead forms, and the converts to a living spirituality.
Works of mercy, ministry, and healing abounded, and
faith, love, and service were multiplied. Such a joy
lighted up the faces of the disciples that they became
familiarly known among the Tarsians as the <q>happy
brotherhood.</q> Although the Pharisaic members of the
synagogue were censorious toward them, they suffered no
persecution.
</p>

<p>
An excursion up the river had been planned by Marcius,
both for the enjoyment of the charming scenery,
and the opportunity for delightful communion and intercourse
which come from the society of kindred souls
possessing a common interest and aim.
</p>

<p>
Besides the family of Benoni, and Serenus and Amabel,
Marcius had invited several other friends to join the
company, and they gathered at Benoni’s house at the
appointed hour in readiness for the start. After a ramble
in the garden, they passed down to the landing to
embark. Some were already on the barge, when suddenly
the sound of rapid footsteps was heard, and a
young man appeared, hastening to reach them before
their departure.
</p>

<pb n="432"/><anchor id="Pg432"/>

<p>
It was Saulus!
</p>

<p>
His father, mother, and Rebecca were the last of the
party, and not yet on board.
</p>

<p>
Each was successively wrapped in his loving embrace,
and tears of joy witnessed the warmth of their reunion.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Saulus, thou must go with us on the excursion!</q>
said Rebecca, as soon as the first greetings were over.
<q>Serenus and Amabel, also Marcius, of whom I have
written thee, are already on the barge!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Serenus on board! I will go! I long to greet him!</q>
</p>

<p>
Soon all were upon the deck of the Felicia, and at a
given signal the twenty oars on each side took the water
as if by one impulse, and the graceful barge glided out
upon the bosom of the Cydnus.
</p>

<p>
Rebecca presented Saulus to Marcius, who received
him warmly, and then they sought Serenus and Amabel.
</p>

<p>
Saulus and Serenus were soon clasped in each other’s
arms.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Serenus! my friend, brother, and saviour! Words
fail me! To thee, whom I once counted as my enemy,
I owe my life and my salvation. Blessed be these eyes
that behold thee, and these ears that hear thy voice!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>And thou, Amabel! who by my command wast taken
to the cruel prison! Sister of the New Faith! I need
not even ask thy forgiveness, for I am persuaded that
thou hast bestowed it long ago. What a joy to forgive
and be forgiven! Rebecca hath written the good tidings
to me.</q>
</p>

<p>
The Felicia was headed up stream, but despite the
strong current she shot rapidly along. The roofs and
towers of the city gradually receded, and pastoral voices
<pb n="433"/><anchor id="Pg433"/>and charms grew more distinct and prevailing. Delicious
exhalations were wafted out from the leaves and
blossoms of spicy shrubs on either hand, and their graceful
forms were duplicated in trembling shadows in the
clear water beneath. Nature furnished a perfect environment
of peace and beauty, inspiring in the souls of
all a revery of silent homage to the Word which she
articulated and out-pictured.
</p>

<p>
Serenus and Saulus sat down side by side, and all
visions of the troubled past melted away in their present
friendliness and rejoicing. Saulus rehearsed to the
group which gathered about him a full narrative of his
thrilling experiences in Damascus, his life and retirement
in the Desert, and his trials in Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
Though an intensity of brotherly love, like that of
<q>David and Jonathan,</q> immediately sprung up between
Serenus and Saulus, it must not be supposed that they
were alike, or thought alike. It is often assumed that
those who differ in natural endowment and personal
opinion must in some measure be separated in sympathy
and interest. Not so. The zealous impetuosity
of Saulus was in strong contrast with the serenity and
evenness of his friend. They were utterly dissimilar in
looks, temperament, and manner of thinking. One
might be compared to a dashing, foaming cataract, the
other to a still, deep river. But their very unlikeness
stimulated their affection.
</p>

<p>
Every unit is composed of unlike elements, and every
truth has its widely varying aspects. It might therefore
be expected that in their efforts to spread the New Faith,
the methods of these two leaders would be unlike.
<pb n="434"/><anchor id="Pg434"/>Still more, the emphasis which each would place upon
all but the most vital and central principles would be
greatly variant.
</p>

<p>
<q>Hath any persecution been meted out to the disciples
of the New Faith in Tarsus?</q> inquired Saulus.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay; we have not been molested. The Tarsians have
little concern either for or against our religion, and our
brethren of the synagogue, while counting us as heretics
and manifesting some bitterness of spirit, have done us
no harm.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How unlike Damascus and Jerusalem! Behold in
those cities all our exhortations in the name of Jesus
of Nazareth filled the multitudes with jealousy, which
brought forth persecution and even scourging.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The minds and hearts of men are not speedily
changed,</q> replied Serenus. <q>Dost thou think it strange,
O my brother! that those men are moved by the same
reasoning that, in time gone by, moved thee to persecute,
thinking that thereby thou wert doing God service? It
is no easy thing to give righteous judgment concerning
the actions of men, unless peradventure we have regard
unto their ignorance, and all their past manner of thinking.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou sayest truly that I ought not to think it
strange that others of the Circumcision persecute, even
as I did, being of like mind; but I pray thee, how is the
gospel of the New Faith to be established unless it be
boldly proclaimed, whether men hear or forbear?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am minded with thee, O Saulus! that the proclamation
of Truth be fearlessly put forth, but it must be
with forbearance and in love. Behold the still, small
<pb n="435"/><anchor id="Pg435"/>voice of the Spirit of Truth findeth a hearing in the
affections of men whose ears are closed to argument and
controversy. If the seed be cast gently into ground that
is well prepared by the mellowing of love, and watered
by the ministry of reconciliation, it will spring up, and
in due season the blade will appear, and finally the full
corn in the ear.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou speakest wisely, O Serenus! for only thy winning
and unresistant spirit awakened a response in my
own heart, that in due time overcame me, and turned my
feet from the path of error and destruction. I am also
minded that thy works in Tarsus are far more abundant
than my vehement logic could have established had I
been in thy place. Lo, from thy youth up thou hadst a
gentleness of spirit, which I, even since my change of
heart, greatly lack.</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus turned lovingly toward Saulus, and taking
him by the hand, replied,—
</p>

<p>
<q>I beseech thee, my brother, have in mind the abundant
power which thou hast, and not the thing which
perchance thou lackest. It is well that we have differing
talents and gifts. Thou canst not perform my work,
nor I thine, but there is a harvest ripening for each of us.
In the earthly vineyard of God the shoulders of every
laborer are justly fitted to the burden which is appointed
for him to bear. But of a verity there are no burdens,
for they are changed to privileges.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thy words reconcile me to my chosen work, and even
to my inner hindrances. I perceive that through spiritual
exercise even our shortcomings minister to advancement
in the higher life.</q>
</p>

<pb n="436"/><anchor id="Pg436"/>

<p>
Tarsus had faded from view, and save the rhythmic
plash of the oars no sound was audible but the hum of
quiet converse among the scattered groups upon the deck
of the Felicia.
</p>

<p>
After listening with interest to the conversation between
Serenus and Saulus, Marcius invited Rebecca’s
attention to the grandeur of the mountains now nearing
as they ascended the river, and soon the twain leisurely
seated themselves in a retired nook near the bow of the
boat.
</p>

<p>
The charm of the crystal Cydnus burnished by the
rays of the sun, its fringed and swiftly passing banks,
and the reposefulness of the broad, outlying landscape,
combined to make the whole scene masterful.
</p>

<p>
<q>How beautiful the world is!</q> said Rebecca.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea,</q> said Marcius. <q>Under the inspiration of the
New Faith the mountains are temples, and the rocks
and trees sacred altars which enshrine the divine beauty
and radiance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A beautiful metaphor! I feel that Nature is soulful
and companionable. The cold, mechanical forms of
institutions, and the hollow ceremonies in temples made
with hands, harden the mind and fetter its freedom. As
our souls are illumined, Nature becomes a Revelation—a
spoken Word—transparent to the Divine Spirit
which shines through it.</q>
</p>

<p>
Marcius was charmed by Rebecca’s poetic consecration,
and added,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea; Serenus teacheth even a threefold Revelation:
that which shineth through the veil of the outer world;
that manifested through men—sons of God—of whom
<pb n="437"/><anchor id="Pg437"/>Jesus was the perfected measure; and that by the ever-present
Spirit, which is the Companion and Teacher.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How clearly the eyes of Serenus are open to the
light and truth of the world!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is a marvel!</q> said Marcius with earnestness.
<q>Blessed be the hour when first I beheld him! Behold
how great good cometh out of evil! The sinking of the
Salapiæ hath yielded a great blessing to Tarsus.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My life in the Holy City and since hath persuaded
me that infinite forces work with us when we work
through them,</q> said Rebecca with enthusiasm. <q>Nothing
is trifling, and nothing unimportant.</q>
</p>

<p>
Marcius felt that the moment had arrived toward
which he had so long looked forward as the most eventful
of his life.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Rebecca!</q> said he in a low, tender tone, as his
eyes glanced upon her fair face, <q>I am minded of another
great blessing to me which hath grown out of
evil!</q>
</p>

<p>
The living emphasis of the soft, earnest words seemed
peculiar, and Rebecca looked up inquiringly, as if to
divine their interpretation.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold the day of the tumult, when thou wert hard
pressed by the rabble! What a wicked offence, and yet
from it hath come to me a revelation of thy beautiful
soul.</q>
</p>

<p>
Rebecca was startled, for there was an intensity behind
the words which swept her spirit into unwonted
vibration.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Rebecca! I would more fully unveil my heart to
thee! Blessed be the day when for the first time I
be<pb n="438"/><anchor id="Pg438"/>held thy sweet face, and thrice blessed the time in which
I have felt thy goodness and purity! I love thee! Thy
father hath graciously yielded me permission to make my
love known to thee. Oh, wilt thou not be the soul of my
soul? The New Faith will consecrate our love, and
make us one in the bonds of a union that shall be unending.
Should there be no certain response in thy
heart at this hour, I will not press thee for an answer
now. But thou art the pure shrine at which my devotion
will glow with an unending ardor!</q>
</p>

<p>
While the calm dignity of Rebecca did not forsake her
the beautiful cheeks took on a ruddier shade, and her
large, radiant eyes were downcast and bedewed.
</p>

<p>
Then, looking steadily into his manly face, she replied
softly,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Hast thou thought carefully of this? Thou art the
Roman Vice Legate of Tarsus, and I but an humble
maid of the Hebrews!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Rebecca, I have pondered it day and night! Never
in my earlier days did I know there could be such love!
But I feel myself to be another man—a new man—or
I would be unspeakably unworthy of thee. I am yet unworthy,
but I offer thee the homage of a heart, purified
I trust, by the higher life, and softened by the effulgence
of thine own goodness.</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a long silence, made more intense by the
rapid beating of two hearts.
</p>

<p>
A smile upon her lips, and the dropping of a tear
which would not stay back, gave him hope.
</p>

<p>
Unspeakable repose filled their souls.

<p>
One beautiful spring morning, <hi rend="small">A.D.</hi> 61, an Alexandrian
ship, flying the sign of Castor and Pollux, entered
the Bay of Puteoli laden with corn for the granaries of
Rome. The mirror-like surface of the water brilliantly
reflected the rays of the early sun, and duplicated the
palaces, gardens, and palm-trees which lined the banks.
The dark-green, vine-clad slopes of Vesuvius, yet a slumbering
giant, towered up from the eastward above the
peaceful towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii, distinguished
for their brilliant color, Greek-like gayety, and
beautiful situation. It was one of the loveliest of earthly
scenes.
</p>

<p>
The luxurious villas and magnificent palaces of Roman
nobles which dotted the shores, and the romantic islets
that lifted themselves out of the blue sea to the west
and southwestward, with the flowering shrubs which
pushed their color and fragrance to the water’s edge, all
contributed features to form an unequalled earthly paradise.
Near by were Baiæ, Pandataria, Cumæ,
Pausi<pb n="442"/><anchor id="Pg442"/>lypus, and Capreæ, each richly endowed with thrilling
classical events and romantic associations of great interest
in the world’s history. The end of the voyage
was at hand, and the passengers gathered upon deck to
enjoy the complex panorama which many of them viewed
for the first time. They represented many different races,
tribes and tongues, and appeared in a picturesque variety
of costumes.
</p>

<p>
Prominent among them was a Roman officer, having in
charge a prisoner who was on his way to Rome for a
trial in the imperial court.
</p>

<p>
The officer, Julius, who wore the insignia of a centurion,
had an intelligent and kindly face, and showed
much respect unto his prisoner, who was a man well
along in years, and of marked individuality.
</p>

<p>
It was Saulus on his journey to the Eternal City upon
an appeal for justice. He was accompanied by Luke
and Aristarchus, though they were not prisoners. He
stood upon the forward deck, engaged in converse with
the centurion.
</p>

<p>
<q>If official duty will enable thee to use thy discretion,
O Julius, I would make an earnest request for thy favor!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Make it known unto me, and if expedient I will be
pleased to grant thy petition.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold yonder house where the gardens reach the
water’s edge! It is but little more than a stadium from
the landing, and is the home of Marcius, a Roman, and
his wife, who is my sister. I fain would tarry there for a
few days before setting out for Rome.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How knowest thou that it is the house of Marcius,
never having sojourned here aforetime?</q>
</p>

<pb n="443"/><anchor id="Pg443"/>

<p>
<q>I am fully persuaded of it through letters which came
to me giving a full description.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have power to grant thy request, and it shall be
as thou dost desire.</q>
</p>

<p>
When all had landed, Julius found upon inquiry that
the house which had been pointed out was as had been
represented, and with a soldier for a guard, Saulus
and his friends were permitted to make the desired
visit.
</p>

<p>
The home of Marcius occupied one of the most beautiful
sites upon the shores of the heavenly bay. The
water, transparent in its blueness, embraced by a lovely
sky and an emerald shore, was so serene that it seemed
to be reposing in a dream of bliss. The air was heavy
with the odors of flowering plants and shrubs, and a
subtle and fascinating spell was wont to steal over the
senses of the observer. Nature was the Charmer.
</p>

<p>
The dark, tangled crags to the southwest seemed like
lazy yet faithful sentinels who were watching lest the
prodigal enchantment might escape, or that its voluptuousness
might tempt the sea to swallow it up. What
a fairy-land to stir the fancies of the heart, and light
a smile of rapture upon the face of him whose soul is
attuned to a beauty that is not only upon the surface,
but within!
</p>

<p>
The three friends, who were entirely unlooked for,
received a most cordial welcome from Marcius and Rebecca,
and their home was a veritable haven of rest after
a long and troublesome voyage. Many years had passed
since Saulus and Rebecca last met, but the ardor of
their early affection, if possible, seemed yet increased.
<pb n="444"/><anchor id="Pg444"/>Saulus for the first time saw his niece Helena, the
daughter of Marcius and Rebecca, who was now in the
bloom of her youthful beauty.
</p>

<p>
After a day of hospitable entertainment and intercourse
in the unity and spirit of the New Faith, the little
group, as the sun declined, was seated upon the front
porch which overlooked the lovely expanse of the waters
of Puteoli. The air was delicious, and a purple haze
enveloped the surrounding slopes and heights, softening
their outlines, and forming a mystical and idealistic
setting for the splendid summer-houses which dotted
the shore and highlands far and near. Upon the bay,
which reflected upon its bosom the splendor of the closing
day, here and there might be seen the sail of some
belated fisherman or pleasure boat, almost becalmed,
or perchance lazily rowing toward the port.
</p>

<p>
Saulus, after gazing meditatively upon the scene for
a little time, broke the silence.
</p>

<p>
<q>In all my journeyings I have beheld no scene so
glorious!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea,</q> said Marcius, <q>we count it as heavenly as
any place on earth well can be. Nearly a score of years
have taken their flight since we came here from the
banks of the Cydnus, and yet whenever I return from
my journeys in other climes it always gives me fresh
delight.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Tell me somewhat of thy journeys, and of thy success
in spreading the New Faith,</q> said Saulus.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold I have little to make mention of in comparison
with the great work which thou hast accomplished!
Not being a public teacher and preacher, my
<pb n="445"/><anchor id="Pg445"/>efforts have had little observation, yet after my own
manner I feel that my work hath not been in vain.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am minded that thou hast devoted most of thy
wealth to the spread of the new gospel,</q> said Saulus,
<q>and assuredly in that direction thou hast done most
effectual service. I would that thou briefly recount to
my brethren, Luke and Aristarchus, somewhat of thy
sacrifices and labors for their encouragement.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My sacrifices have been light compared with those
which each of you has made, yet I have tried to be
faithful. To this day no persecution hath been meted
out to me, but I yet may feel the displeasure of Nero.
No one can tell. Claudius was content with my simple
deposition from office in Tarsus, and since that day I
have lived undisturbed as a Roman private citizen.</q>
</p>

<p>
But Saulus desired to hear further.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have learned through letters from the hand of Rebecca
that thou hast sent trusted disciples to the ends of
the earth, and that thine own journeyings have reached
to Britain, Spain, and Africa.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It hath been my privilege to send a few laborers into
the vineyard, and furnish them with the means of support.
In my visits to these lands I have seen somewhat of the
fruits of their labors, and letters lately received give me
hope of their growing success.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold there is a diversity of gifts and members in
the new kingdom!</q> said Luke; <q>and I perceive that
thou, O Marcius! hast done a great work that hath not
been chronicled by the churches or known to the saints
at Jerusalem. The world is a great field, and there are
divers ways of scattering the good seed of the Word.</q>
</p>

<pb n="446"/><anchor id="Pg446"/>

<p>
<q>While thou art with us, O brother Saulus! I would
that thou interpret more fully the life and doctrine of the
great Prophet of Nazareth!</q> said Marcius. <q>The disciples
with whom I have had converse appear to think
differently, in some degree, concerning the best way of
salvation and the true ideal of the New Faith.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Wherein lieth the difference?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Some seem to teach that the new life is likeness in
mind and spirit to Jesus, or an incarnation of the inner
Christly quality, while others hold that it is a purchase
which was made by his sufferings and death. They say
that his blood, though greater than other Jewish sacrifices,
in the same manner cleanseth from transgression
and bestoweth pardon.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I have observed that some such differences are beginning
to appear among believers, but am fully persuaded
that the Spirit will not be swallowed up by the
letter. A knowledge of Jesus, the Christ, after the flesh,
profiteth nothing. If I have known him after the flesh, I
would know him no more.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is the significance of the shedding of blood?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Blood signifieth the inner quality or life, and not the
suffering and death. Behold the literal blood availeth
naught! Jesus was only the outward manifestation of
the Christ, because the Saviour of men is not flesh, but
spirit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What doth belief in the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> of Christ signify?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is that Christ, or the mind of Christ, liveth in us
as it lived in Jesus, though not so fully manifested.
Faith in Christ is not mere belief in the death and resurrection
of the Prophet of Nazareth, but it is the
sub<pb n="447"/><anchor id="Pg447"/>stance of spiritual life in man. Jesus belonged to a
particular time and place, while the Christ is the divine
son in all men, even though not yet born into activity.
It is God in the soul of man!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A saving truth! and how near, for it is an experience
of the heart,</q> said Rebecca.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea; the Christ is in every man, and not far away in
time or distance. He is the name of divine oneness in
the children of men, whether in the seed, the blade, or
the full corn in the ear. Ordinances and sacraments are
without, but Christ, the Truth, is within. A fleshly and
sacrificial belief manifesteth itself in form and ceremony,
and bringeth forth a harvest of dead works which killeth
the spirit.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I feel the truth of what thou sayest, for it is easy of
comprehension!</q> said Marcius with earnestness.
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea; no man need err therein. Christ is not a dead
Christ, but the living, ever-present son or image waiting
for birth and articulation in every human soul. Behold
the whole creation groaneth together in bringing forth
the sons of God!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Didst thou not in thine early teaching dwell much
upon the seen Jesus and his sacrificial death?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, thou judgest rightly; but now I see more plainly
that that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that
which is born of the Spirit is spirit. I have learned
that the worship of the Father pertaineth not to time,
place, nor race, but must be in spirit and in truth. Behold
all men, whether Jews or Gentiles, bond or free,
are blindly feeling after God, but through ignorance they
make many vain searches! But full contentment can
<pb n="448"/><anchor id="Pg448"/>never come to any soul until it knoweth the Father and
his kingdom within.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of the reputed sayings of the Nazarene, some appear
to come from a son of man, and others from a son
of God. Canst thou make that plain to us?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Man hath within him both the human and divine
nature, and Jesus being fully manifested in the God-consciousness,
and recognizing his oneness with the Father,
at divers times spoke as God in the flesh, and also upon
other occasions as a son of man. Behold God, though
not flesh, dwelleth in all flesh, but man knoweth it not,
and thinketh of him as far away.</q>
</p>

<p>
Early the next morning Serenus and Amabel also
arrived at the house of Marcius. They came for a brief
sojourn before taking ship for Alexandria, now their
home, being on their return from a short visit to Rome.

<head>CHAPTER XXXVI<lb/>NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW WITH A SEER</head>

<epigraph><lg>
<l>“I sent my soul through the invisible,</l>
<l>Some lessons of the after life to spell,</l>
<l>By and by it came and answered,</l>
<l>I myself am heaven and hell.”</l>
</lg>
</epigraph>

<p>
Joy reigned in the house of Marcius. The unlooked-for
arrival of Serenus and Amabel brought about a general
and happy reunion of friends who long had been
widely separated.
</p>

<p>
The abode of Serenus was now in Alexandria. As
the worthy successor of Philo, he was the eminent head
of a school of liberal Christian philosophy, where teachers
and missionaries were trained and educated. The
academy was not devoted to mere philosophical speculation
and theorizing, but to the promulgation of the
New Faith in its pristine purity. Both by precept and
example Serenus inculcated a practical spiritual life
which transformed those who came within its moulding
influence. The school became a living fountain, from
which went out the waves of a Christly Christianity.
Set free, even in greater measure than the Primitive
Church, from Jewish dogmatism, the truth was purged
from all traditional rubbish, and given out in all its intrinsic
value and beauty. It was the simple New Faith,
<pb n="450"/><anchor id="Pg450"/>without any admixture of asceticism, touched and gilded
by the light of the highest and best Greek philosophy
and idealism. The influence upon the world at large
of the Alexandrian liberal school of Christianity, not
being recorded in canonized history, has been mostly
unrecognized in ecclesiastical annals.
</p>

<p>
The day after the arrival of Serenus and Amabel
passed swiftly in mutual converse and encouragement.
Every one of the reunited circle had much to recount.
What a wealth of experiences gained, obstacles overcome,
and inspirations kindled!
</p>

<p>
Late in the evening Marcius felt a strange and unwonted
spirit of restlessness. All the rest of the household
had retired for the night, when some intangible but
powerful influence almost impelled him to go into the
open air for a season of meditation and communion with
the spirit of Nature. Telling Rebecca of his intention, he
went out upon the porch and took his favorite seat overlooking
the beautiful bay. The harmony and sublimity
of the scene were borne in upon his soul, and gave him a
sense of profound serenity. The air was soft and balmy,
and the full-orbed moon was lifting herself above the
horizon in queenly majesty, lighting up the expanse of
waters with a sheen of wavy silver.
</p>

<p>
The arrival of Saulus, and yet more that of Serenus
and Amabel, brought before the mind of Marcius a flood
of former associations and emotions interwoven with his
life upon the banks of the Cydnus. His inner experiences
of the earlier time passed before him in a procession
like the unrolling of a scenic panorama. His
Christianity was also free from a too-prevalent
asceti<pb n="451"/><anchor id="Pg451"/>cism, and the charm of everything about him found a
response and revelation in his own soul. As he pondered,
while drinking in the beauty of the night, he
measurably divested himself of the gross sense of the
Physical, and wandered back amid bygone soul-experiences.
He realized that to penetrate the unseen realm
of Reality there must be earnest desire, unclouded by
the opaque objects of sense, usually so all controlling.
</p>

<p>
He journeyed psychically backward, and analyzed his
early life,—its selfishness, grossness, and superficiality.
He thought of those who shared it. Where are they
now? What occupies them? Have they yet discerned the
hollowness of the mad pursuit of sensuous gratification?
</p>

<p>
What of Leander?
</p>

<p>
At that moment he was somewhat startled by the dignified
approach of a man wrapped in a long mantle who
came near and called him by name. In a reposeful and
deliberate manner the stranger leaned against a pillar
and waited for a response. His voice was musical, his
face had a pleasant and impressive aspect, indicating
refined character and a passionless depth of thought,
heightened by a noble forehead and deep-set eyes.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am Marcius! Be seated, and explain thine errand!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I come as a messenger, rather than for myself,</q> replied
the strange visitor in a cordial and friendly manner.
<q>Thy musing upon the secrets of the soul and the
mysteries of the Universe, but more especially thy delving
among the living relics of the past, hath awakened
a yearning in other souls,—or a soul,—and thou only
hast the power to satisfy it!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou speakest in riddles! how did it come to thee,
<pb n="452"/><anchor id="Pg452"/>or to those for whom thou hast come, that my thought
was occupied with the past? Behold the scene of my
earlier experiences is far distant.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>In mind and spirit there is no time nor distance!
The echoes of thought go out, and are interpreted by
those whose inner hearing is attuned. Not only the
music of a fountain, but even the hoarse roar of a tempest,
is heard within, and can be stilled only from the
centre! There is a disquieted soul that earnestly craves
thine aid. Even a word from thee would help to relieve
its distresses.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Again thou speakest beyond my comprehension.
What dost thou desire me to do?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Go with me to a place not very far distant where all
mystery shall be made plain to thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou hast much assurance to ask me to go with thee,
a stranger, to a place unknown! Common prudence
might forbid.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do I seem like one born to deceive? Only good can
or will come from thy compliance.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Whom do we seek, if I go with thee?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My Superior! A wise and noble magician. One
who hath profound and prophetic gifts of soul, and hath
penetrated deeply into the mysteries of Knowledge, as
found in the life of man.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I will go with thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
The moon had hidden herself behind dense masses of
floating clouds so that the darkness had perceptibly increased,
but Marcius was thoroughly persuaded of the
sincerity of his guide, and did not hesitate.
</p>

<p>
They started. After traversing several narrow streets
<pb n="453"/><anchor id="Pg453"/>and turning many corners, they took a road which wound
steadily upward. On, on, on!—would they never arrive
at the journey’s end? The deep obscurity and many
turns caused Marcius to lose his bearings, and he had
little or no idea even of the general direction which
they had taken. In the gradual ascent they crossed two
streams upon whose classical banks in bygone ages had
encamped the invading hosts of Etruscan, Sybarite, and
Roman. The whole vicinity was rich with ancient lore.
Still on, until, with a sharp turn to the right, they passed
through a deep and narrow fissure which parted a hill of
rock, and was shrouded by abundant foliage.
</p>

<p>
Emerging from the narrow walled passage, immediately
before them, upon a level plateau, stood a venerable
castle. The light which streamed through a few of
the windows gave evidence of life within.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold our journey’s end!</q> said the stranger.
</p>

<p>
They entered, and after mounting a broad, winding
staircase, Marcius was ushered into the presence of a
tall, dignified and venerable man, with long hair and
flowing beard of snowy whiteness, who received him with
becoming and polite cordiality. He was wrapped in a
long white mantle, heavily embroidered in gold with
mystical and occult designs. After the first greetings, he
motioned Marcius to a convenient seat. The room was
commodious, and possessed many remains of ancient
splendor fairly well preserved. It contained large tables
of costly marble elaborately carved, upon which were
piles of parchment sheets and rolls, and also many astrological,
chemical, and philosophical instruments and
appliances.
</p>

<pb n="454"/><anchor id="Pg454"/>

<p>
<q>I am here in obedience to thy request?</q> said Marcius
inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
The kindly face of the Seer lighted up with a beneficent
smile, as he replied,—
</p>

<p>
<q>I give thee cordial welcome, and am persuaded that
thy visit will not be in vain. I have knowledge of thy
good works, and that thou hast delight in the upliftment
and release of entangled souls.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am in no wise minded how my strange visit hath
any virtue in such an accomplishment!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Peradventure there be unseen prisoners struggling
for freedom that thou knowest not of.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I shall rejoice in any opportunity for spiritual ministry,</q>
said Marcius; <q>but if thou art pleased to communicate,
may I first inquire concerning thyself and thy
profession?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I am descended from the Magi of the far East. My
father was one of the wise men who brought offerings to
the Babe of Bethlehem, an observer of the stars, and
skilled in magic. I have dwelt in many lands, sojourning
for some time in Athens before coming here.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Of what avail is the mystery and seclusion which are
wrapped about thy seership?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold the minds of this generation are descended
from the spiritual altitude of the sages of the earlier
world, therefore the mysteries of the Universe, and of
mind and spirit, must be veiled and guarded from the
sensuous vulgarity of the present age. How long, thinkest
thou, should we be permitted to cultivate acquaintance
with mysticism and spiritual science if our Art
were made known to Nero? Behold if water is to mirror
<pb n="455"/><anchor id="Pg455"/>the heavens it must be still and deep, and wholly unruffled
by the winds of Circumstance! Our wisdom would
shrink to naught unless lifted beyond the murky atmosphere
of the sense and selfishness of every-day life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I perceive the truth of what thou speakest, and would
know further of thy philosophy and aspiration.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold the Divine One is unveiled in many ways to
the inner vision of men. Our distinctive reading of Him
is through the pages of Nature. We find living oracular
voices in the poetry and harmony of the Universe, and
also in the underlying laws of the mind of man. To interpret
Nature and Law is to interpret God. We must
study the adumbration, locution, and the architecture of
the whole creation. All is <hi rend="italic">life</hi>, and life is <hi rend="small">LOVE</hi>. In
the world of sense love is personal and narrow. In the
higher spheres it reduces all things to itself, and becomes
impersonal and all-inclusive. To penetrate the secrets
of the Universal Mind and discover the invisible revolving
wheels of Nature, one must ascend an unseen mount—<hi rend="small">ALONE</hi>.
Only through such solitude can the soul
uncover itself and come into full contact with the Eternal,
and at length gain a complete mastery over the base
idolatry of the common life.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I fain would know more particularly concerning thine
own chosen field of research?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I may make known to thee that the Magi of the East
are of three Orders, different, though related, for they
are One. The triangle hath three sides. The first Order
is given mainly to the study of and communion with Nature,
or rather her motives and internal forces. The
second is concerned with the assuagement and healing
<pb n="456"/><anchor id="Pg456"/>of the ills and disorders of the race, and the third seeks
near acquaintance with the mysteries and manifestations
of Spirit while abiding in incarnate forms, and also the
invoking of those that have become excarnate. It includes
a study of the laws, communications, and unfoldment
of human minds and souls. My own researches
and experiments are more specifically those of the third
Order, to which I have the honor to belong.</q>
</p>

<p>
The thought of Marcius went back to Alethea.
</p>

<p>
<q>My own small experience hath convinced me, not
only that spirits survive earthly dissolution, but that
they sometimes appear in the seen form.</q>
</p>

<p>
The sage nodded assent, and observed,—
</p>

<p>
<q>It is true that those who are in the Beyond, under
certain favorable circumstances not commonly understood,
may briefly draw to themselves some of the finer elements
of neighboring bodies, and even clothe themselves with
them. This is no marvel! It is in accord with the spiritual
laws of man’s constitution. When embodied, Mind
commands its own organism. In lesser degree, after the
seen hath been dropped, its inherent forces may lay hold
of the subtle elements that are less closely related, and
mould them for a temporary purpose.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do those who cross the Styx find upon landing upon
the farther side that they are much wiser, and at once
rid of the errors of the fleshly experience?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay; the higher states come only by growth into harmony
with the Universal Good, which is through patient
and persistent aspiration. Most souls are inert until
pushed forward by the pains of discordant environment.
The same faults must be overcome, the same phantoms
<pb n="457"/><anchor id="Pg457"/>vanquished and selfishness put away, as in the seen.
The wonted passions rage, even though without material
expression. But thanks to friendly thought-ministration
from intelligences more highly developed, both in the
visible and invisible, progress soon begins, and will continue.
The cords that hold spirits in prison must be
weakened in every strand through retributive and purifying
discipline until they finally give way, and then released
souls can mount aloft into a larger freedom. To
put on a heavenly consciousness at once would be a violation
of all the laws of normal growth and universal
method. Thought must wear new channels, whether
with or without the cruder embodiment.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is there a spiritual body?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There is a finer form, which is gently released when
the grosser embodiment drops away, being no longer fit
for occupancy. To the clear vision of a Hierophant
there are even soul tints and colors which emanate from
living forms, and index the quality of their thought. The
delicate goodly hues of thine own inner nature have been
plainly visible to me since thou entered yonder door.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Do the spiritual atmospheres of those upon the plane
of the seen touch each other, and make themselves felt
beyond the boundaries of the body?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, like auras, meet and mingle harmoniously, while
those which are discordant in color and vibration are
mutually repellant. There is an all-pervading ethereal
Substance which fills all space, and is also penetrative of
all matter. It is the medium which connects individualized
thought with the Universal Mind. As the trembling
strings of a harp launch its music upon the undulations
<pb n="458"/><anchor id="Pg458"/>of the atmosphere, so the waves of thought are wafted
through that Infinite Ocean in which we dwell to their
desired Destination, or perchance forth into ever-increasing
outward <anchor id="corr458"/><corr sic="(no quote mark)">circles.</corr></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is matter?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Matter is spirit in its crudest manifestation. It is
the primary educational plane of soul, or, in other words,
the moulding material for its elementary practice. Individuated
soul builds it up into organic forms. We must
not forget also that there are innumerable grades of individuated
souls below the plane of the Human.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What wouldst thou interpret as the basic principle
of all life?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Love, which when manifested in the lower forms
of matter, we call attraction or gravitation, pervades
the Universe, and is the mainspring of all life. As it
rises in the scale of unfolding Being it becomes refined
and spiritualized. All individuated consciousness must
finally come into harmonic vibration with the Universal
Spirit. Behold the Divine One hath made everything
from <hi rend="small">HIMSELF</hi>! But the moments flee. Peradventure
thou wouldst know more fully the definite purpose for
which thy visit was desired?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I await thy convenience.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>A disquieted Intelligence, for some time beyond the
confines of visibility, craveth converse with thee. Peradventure
thou mayest be able to accomplish much in
giving release and bringing reconciliation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I cannot divine who or what It may be!</q> replied
Marcius with an expression of deep curiosity.
</p>

<p>
The Seer then arose, and inviting Marcius to follow,
<pb n="459"/><anchor id="Pg459"/>led the way into an adjoining room. There was no
light save the rays of the full moon which came in
brightly through two casements, the clouds having dispersed.
The door was closed, and Marcius shown to
a seat.
</p>

<p>
The room was octagonal in shape, and of moderate
size, except in height, which was great in proportion
to the other dimensions. Upon the vaulted ceiling far
above there were dim points of light, which like stars
seemed to have a luminosity of their own. High above
their heads small Æolian harps hung in valves which
were open to the gentle zephyrs without, and they were
discoursing soft, sweet melody which seemed more like
heavenly whisperings than earthly music.
</p>

<p>
Soon the Seer gave a signal, upon which a man clad
in loose white robes entered and seated himself upon
a dais between the two casements. There was sufficient
light to show Marcius that the face was that of the
messenger who had guided him to the castle. The
harmony, beauty, and softness of the whole scene was
so impressive that he awaited some demonstration
with anxious expectancy. His thoughts turned once
more back to Alethea, and his heart beat quickly at
the memory of the vision long ago in the Tarsian
<foreign rend="italic">adytum</foreign>.
</p>

<p>
But see! A tremor passes over the frame of the figure
upon the dais. His breast heaves, his muscles relax,
his eyelids droop, and he seems like one entranced.
</p>

<p>
Anon a mist, at first so rare as to be barely discernible,
formed in a gathering cloud just before the
dais!
</p>

<pb n="460"/><anchor id="Pg460"/>

<p>
It gains in density, gradually solidifies, and finally
assumes definite form!
</p>

<p>
<q>Leander!</q>
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
Marcius marvelled!
</p>

<p>
The same wavy brown hair!—dark blue eyes!—fair
complexion, with skin white, as if polished with baths
and oil! His costume was that of an actor in dramatic
representation.
</p>

<p>
Marcius was still more surprised when Leander assumed
an oratorical attitude, and in his old-time impassioned
manner began the recitation of Greek poetry.
Then followed a scene from one of the tragedies of
Sophocles. After closing, he waited a moment, as if expecting
applause.
</p>

<p>
Marcius almost forgot the present in such a realistic
dream of the past.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold,</q> said the Master in a whisper, <q>the persistence
of mental habit! Pressing though his business be
with thee, this dramatic fragment must needs be projected
from his surcharged soul before he can give his
message!</q>
</p>

<p>
Leander now came forward and laid his hand upon
the shoulder of Marcius. An intensely woeful expression
was manifest.
</p>

<p>
<q>O Marcius! I have sent for thee! Behold I am disquieted!
I fain would quench the hatred toward thee
that was long ago kindled in my soul, but am not able!
In spite of every effort it reasserts itself through habit!
It is like a fire which when smothered in one place
<pb n="461"/><anchor id="Pg461"/>breaketh out anew of itself! I crave thy forgiveness,
which, if thou dost grant it, may peradventure help to
release me from this terrible thraldom!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Take courage, for it is freely granted! I give thee
my love, and pronounce thy release!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I bless thy goodness, and thank thee that thou wast
minded to follow the messenger to this place! But I
have yet a great work to do! Behold the old thoughts
rise up before me and will not be laid!</q>
</p>

<p>
Marcius gave him a kindly look, and replied,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Think of love, <hi rend="italic">love</hi>, <hi rend="small">LOVE</hi>! for behold its presence
in thy soul will at length displace all its opposites!
That is the method by which thou mayest dissolve them
into nothingness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, O Marcius! I have not yet told thee the worst!
I tried to murder thee! With base gold I bought a potion
that was to dull thy reason, destroy thy wisdom,
and hasten thy mind and body to decay before the
wonted time! Listen to my iniquity! With more gold,
by my direction, Colurus was hired to administer the
potion to thee! But, thanks to all the gods—none of
which I have beheld since I left the body—thou art here
and well! The potion took no effect, but, oh, the guilt is
not the less! I am tormented beyond measure for having
so rewarded the best friend I ever had! A fire rageth
within my thought, and I have no rest! Horror and
destruction, in living forms, follow and point at me!</q>
</p>

<p>
He groaned in spirit, and tears rolled down his face.
</p>

<p>
<q>In vain have I called unceasingly upon the gods for
release! I love thee now! but the old hateful thoughts,
like foul spirits, thrust themselves continually before me!</q>
</p>

<pb n="462"/><anchor id="Pg462"/>

<p>
<q>Calm thyself, Leander! All will yet be well! Love
finally will conquer!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, O Marcius! added to murderous thoughts of
thee, my appetites of the flesh yet rage within my mind,
even though I have no flesh to fulfil them!</q>
</p>

<p>
The Seer cast a benignant glance upon Leander, and
said reassuringly,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold thou hast repented of all thy sins, and they
are in process of being cast out. Beneficent laws have
ordained that growth cometh through pain. Virtue is
valuable because it costs much, and its sweetness cometh
from intelligent contrast. As Marcius hath well said,
only love can heal thy disquietude. But time is necessary,
for there are no sudden leaps in soul. All things
grow only from cultivation and desire.</q>
</p>

<p>
Leander paced the room with intense agitation, as if
impelled by some evil spirit, but at length, by great effort,
stopped before Marcius, and kneeled with bowed head.
</p>

<p>
<q>Bless thee once more for thy hearty forgiveness! My
distress is a little lessened because I behold something
of the light of the future which thou hast pointed out!
Oh, how I bless thee for thy words—love—<hi rend="italic">love</hi>—<hi rend="small">LOVE</hi>!
Only love can give me peace! I will grasp it,
cling to it, and think of nothing else! I will love both
gods and men—everything!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thy love shall wax, and the day will be hastened
when thy chains shall be fully broken. My forgiveness
and affection shall forever rest upon thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
A backward step, and anon his form became cloudy
and indefinable. Then, slowly, like a summer evening’s
cloud, it dissolved, and was seen no more.

<head>CHAPTER XXXVII<lb/>TWO WOEFUL SOULS RELEASED</head>

<p>
It was a little before mid-day, and the forum and
market-place of Puteoli were filled with a throng which
represented a mingling of different races, avocations, and
professions. Some were in favorite places of resort,
passing the hours in <foreign rend="italic">dolce far niente</foreign>, and even the busy
ones moved leisurely under the influence of the soft and
luxurious atmosphere of southern Italy. Life among
all classes was spent mainly out-of-doors, or in public
places like the temples, baths, forum, or porticos.
Simply to exist in such a climate was a dreamy luxury.
The passive enjoyment of the present hour barred out
any anxious future. If an earthquake caused some trembling
of the immediate environment to-day, they were
yet willing to let to-morrow take care for the things of
itself.
</p>

<p>
Here and there was a sleek and luxurious Roman
noble, a senator, or perchance some member of the
court of Nero, whose country home was on the coast,
jostled by merchants and seamen from every clime of the
then known world. The long toga of the magistrate or
lawyer was brushed by the picturesque costume of the
peasant, the embroidered tunic of the pleasure-seeker, or
perchance the rags of a beggar.
</p>

<pb n="464"/><anchor id="Pg464"/>

<p>
Here, as in the neighboring cities of Herculaneum
and Pompeii, Grecian art had taken early root, and frescos,
carvings, and other ornate decoration covered every
available space.
</p>

<p>
Near the heart of the business quarter on the side of
a colonnade were the stalls of the money-changers, with
their shining heaps in full view, which were the fruit of
exchanges of the coins of many nations, the corn, animal
products, and merchandise of which were landed here on
the way to the Eternal City. At intervals the statue of
some one of the Cæsars, a triumphal arch, a bronze or
marble god or goddess, with frequent fountains whose
iridescent spray danced and sparkled in the sunlight,
gave variety and artistic beauty to the scene.
</p>

<p>
Petty traders displayed their varied wares, and artificers
fashioned their handiwork and deftly exercised their
different crafts with a well-ordered professional skill.
The easy-going life of the great majority, to outward
appearance, seemed like a long-drawn-out poetic revery.
Gayety and love of pleasure and show glistened on the
surface of the complex river of life that flowed smoothly
along.
</p>

<p>
The temple of Jupiter occupied one side of the forum,
and a straggling and variable procession passed in and
out, who came to pay their devotions to the chief god of
the Roman state. In plain sight of the temple, fronting
on a narrow street which led from the forum, and on the
same side, was a plain, square building, somewhat resembling
a Jewish synagogue. This was the meeting-place
of a small congregation of the members of the New
Faith, which was composed of divers races, including a
<pb n="465"/><anchor id="Pg465"/>few Jews who had left behind their national ceremonialism.
The outgoing waves of the new spiritual movement
in the East had reached this distant shore, and, chiefly
through the influence of Marcius and Rebecca, had crystallized
into an organization.
</p>

<p>
Up to this time there had been no dangerous persecution,
though much prejudice and dishonor had been
visited upon the disciples. They had been contemptuously
designated as <q>atheists,</q> <q>despisers of the fine
arts,</q> <q>maligners of the gods and the temple,</q> and by
common reputation rated as disloyal to the <q>divine
Cæsar.</q>
</p>

<p>
The great fame of Saulus as an apostle, preacher, and
healer had long before preceded him, and soon the news
of his arrival, as a prisoner on his way to Rome, became
noised abroad. Serenus also, though less known to the
common people, had much reputation.
</p>

<p>
On the day already noted, being the fifth after the
landing of Saulus, a noisy group, composed mainly of
idlers who frequented the streets, gathered near the
meeting-place of the disciples. In the midst of the
boisterous crowd, a man whose appearance indicated
that he was of the lower orders, seemed to be the principal
subject of an animated controversy.
</p>

<p>
<q>He is no other than the cripple!</q> said one.
</p>

<p>
<q>He is not the cripple, but is like him!</q> said another.
</p>

<p>
The man was straight, and had full command of his
limbs, and began to dance with a light step to show
his agility. His name was Lausus, formerly a sailor,
but from the effect of a fall several years before had
<pb n="466"/><anchor id="Pg466"/>long been a cripple. He had sold small trinkets about
the streets until he became familiarly known as <q>The
Cripple.</q>
</p>

<p>
The dispute continued.
</p>

<p>
<q>He is the cripple and has been healed!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is a hypocrite, and one of the fanatics who are
traitors to Cæsar! I declare to you that they are sorcerers,
and worship a Nazarene Jew whom they call
Christus!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is truly Lausus! let him speak for himself!</q>
</p>

<p>
There was a pause as he beckoned for silence.
</p>

<p>
<q>I am the lame man who for so long hath sold ornaments!
Behold I am healed of my trouble!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How wast thou restored?</q> asked one who seemed
willing to learn the truth.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold two members of the household of the New
Faith, who are guests of Marcius, the Roman, laid hands
upon me, and my limbs are whole!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What are their names?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Saulus and Serenus.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What did they say to thee?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>After laying their hands upon me, in the name of
the God of the whole earth, they declared my lameness
healed!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is Lausus, and his word is true, for I was a
witness!</q> said another.
</p>

<p>
<q>I was healed of blindness!</q> cried a new voice.
</p>

<p>
<q>Another deceiver and fanatic!</q> growled a bystander.
</p>

<p>
<q>Two days ago I was able only to behold a little
light when the sun shone brightly, and now, God be
thanked, I can see clearly!</q>
</p>

<pb n="467"/><anchor id="Pg467"/>

<p>
<q>What did they tell thee?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q><q>Thy faith hath given thee sight! Give God the
praise!</q></q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Did they not touch thine eyes?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, they anointed them; but said that it was only
an outward symbol, and that it was my own faith that
restored me!</q>
</p>

<p>
Still other voices in the crowd gave marvellous testimonies
of wonderful works.
</p>

<p>
The throng was divided. Some mocked, and cried
out that it was only a conspiracy to bring the New
Faith into favor.
</p>

<p>
The tumult increased, and the crowd grew larger.
</p>

<p>
<q>Down with them! they are dreamers and beside
themselves!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay, they speak the truth!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Their pretended healings are lies! I have heard
that they are murderers of new-born babes!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is a slander!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Down with the deceivers! drive them out!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Is it wrong to heal disease?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>They show contempt to Jupiter and all the gods by
paying homage to a Jew!</q>
</p>

<p>
The controversy grew more bitter, and at length ended
with the beating of Lausus, and he was left almost helpless;
but soon he was borne away by some of the brethren.
The aid of the twain who had ministered relief
before was again sought, and he speedily recovered from
his bruises.
</p>

<p>
The tumult, the rumors of healing, their denial and
affirmation, with the violent aspersion of the doctrines
<pb n="468"/><anchor id="Pg468"/>and practices of the members of the New Faith, caused
a widespread dispute and division among the people of
the entire coast. The opposers of the new movement
stoutly maintained that the examples of healing were
temporary and imaginary, and that those upon whom the
works had been wrought were self-deceived, or that they
never had been afflicted with any veritable disorders.
</p>

<p>
The two visitors found themselves the subjects of a
great controversy, which grew to be so earnest that even
the influence of Marcius hardly could protect them from
insult on one side, and homage and almost deification on
the other. Their fame spread so rapidly that calls came
from all directions; and when the day had ended they
had ministered to scores of sick folk, and brought restoration
and health into outward manifestation.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold your works of mercy have stirred up much
commotion among the people of Puteoli!</q> said Marcius,
as the household gathered at the close of the day’s
experiences.
</p>

<p>
<q>It is ever thus!</q> said Saulus. <q>The outward signs
and fruits which follow and attest the glow of the higher
life are an inspiration to those who believe and accept
them, but a rock of offence and stumbling to the faithless.
The selfsame works, therefore, may bless or curse in due
measure, according to the manner in which they are
received.</q>
</p>

<p>
Just then the conversation was interrupted by the coming
of a messenger, who besought Saulus and Serenus to
visit a man who was violently possessed of an evil spirit.
They started immediately, and were led for some distance
through the darkness of the evening, finally halting
be<pb n="469"/><anchor id="Pg469"/>fore the large and richly appointed country-house of a
Roman patrician. Entering the spacious court, they were
met by the wife and a few other friends of the afflicted
man, who was no other than the owner of the villa.
</p>

<p>
<q>We have heard of your wonderful works, but wot not
by what power they are wrought; and now behold the
master of the house is grievously tormented, and a rich
reward will be given if you will restore him.</q>
</p>

<p>
The Roman matron added her importunate request.
</p>

<p>
<q>O sirs! he is a kind and upright man when the demon
doth not possess him! Can you cast out the foul
spirit? Behold when it useth him he is exceeding fierce,
so that he must needs be bound with chains. Silver and
gold in abundance shall be yours if peradventure you
can compass his release.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>We come not for silver and gold!</q> said Serenus;
<q>but in the name of the Eternal Spirit of Goodness, to
bring joy, peace, and salvation to this house. Thy husband
shall be restored.</q>
</p>

<p>
Two strong attendants led the way, a few steps in advance,
to a massive room in the basement, where the
Roman was securely bound with chains. He glared
fiercely as they entered, and sprang forward to the full
length of his bonds to attack them. Serenus and Saulus
followed immediately behind, and so soon as his eyes
rested upon them he relaxed and sank quietly into a seat,
trembling, and frothing at the mouth as if in a fit. He
was a large man, and clad in a thick leathern garb that
he might not wound himself. His manly features and
noble forehead were distorted with rage, his nostrils distended,
and his eyes shot out fiery glances until they
<pb n="470"/><anchor id="Pg470"/>softened and partly closed at the sight of the unwonted
visitors. Soon he sat upright, and was in a more quiet
but still defiant mood, though he did not try again to
arise.
</p>

<p>
Saulus was the first to speak.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou foul and wicked spirit! in the name of the
same ever-present Christ that had full and visible manifestation
through Jesus of Nazareth, I command thee to
come out of him!</q>
</p>

<p>
The man was shaken as if by a paroxysm, but after
much effort opened his lips.
</p>

<p>
<q>Through the mouth of this man I confess unto thee
that I am both foul and wicked, as thou hast said, and
that I must needs obey thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus turned lovingly toward his companion.
</p>

<p>
<q>Brother Saulus, I pray thee, before sending him away
to darkness and despair, if thou wilt, let us hold brief
converse with him. Behold is he not bound and in torment,
and doth not he also need release, even as this
Roman?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>O Serenus, thou speakest with thy wonted wisdom!
I thank thee, for I thought only of the Roman! With
all my long missionary experiences I may still gain further
knowledge and mercy from thee. I beseech thee,
do what seemeth good in thine own eyes.</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus then came near, and calmly looked into the
man’s face.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why dost thou torment this Roman who hath never
done aught against thee?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold I am in a rage of misery which is the bitter
fruit of my life while in the flesh, and I have found
<pb n="471"/><anchor id="Pg471"/>a certain satisfaction in the control and sensations of a
material body of expression!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Why didst thou choose this man?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>His weak personality lacked any positive moral and
spiritual strength, therefore he offered no resistance to
my occupation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Now thou speakest the words of soberness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thy presence hath calmed my anger, and, for the
hour, restored my power to reason understandingly.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou hast been an adversary to everything good or
Godlike?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea; in my sight everything seemed to be against
me, and I raged against everything in return, and that
kindled a hell within my soul.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold the Spirit of the Eternal Goodness is everywhere,
and is All, but so long as thou dost resist it, or
any of its offspring, whether in the fleshly garb or out
of it, thou dost make torture for thyself!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It hath tormented me beyond measure!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold, as thou hast possessed this man’s organism,
hatred, envy, and malice likewise have possessed thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Thou dost perfectly discern the truth!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I now declare unto thee, that even as we, through the
divinity that is lodged within us, can deliver this man
from the bondage of thy possession, so, if thou wouldst,
we may liberate thee from the prison of thy bondage!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Peradventure I might fall back and again be made
captive!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay; there is one merciful Deliverer who hath all
the keys for thy release, and is always with thee! He
will ever serve thee if thou dost call upon him!</q>
</p>

<pb n="472"/><anchor id="Pg472"/>

<p>
<q>A strange doctrine! Who and where is he?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is Love! and is here! Call his name, think his
thoughts, and feel his spirit, and thou mayest forever be
free, or on the path toward freedom!</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus then placed his hand upon the head of the
Roman.
</p>

<p>
<q>Through the divine channel of my own Being, I pronounce
freedom for thee and for this man whom thou
hast possessed!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I feel in myself a strange influx of new peace and
harmony! Behold I never knew these things before!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Now thou dost release forever this man of thine own
free will, and also seek thine own release in the way
marked out?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>With all my mind and strength! Oh, I bless thee
that thou didst not send me back to my former despair!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Go in peace! And to make thine own freedom more
perfect and abundant, labor for the release of those of
thy brethren who are yet bound!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>My saviour, I will! Behold I go!</q>
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
The Roman aroused himself and glanced about him
with strange surprise. As he slowly arose there was a
clanking of chains. He stared in wonder at them, and
then at his leathern raiment, and looking around awaited
an explanation. There was a momentary silence as he
surveyed his strong attendants, and then glanced into
the faces of Serenus and Saulus.
</p>

<p>
<q>Where am I? and what has happened? Oh, what
<pb n="473"/><anchor id="Pg473"/>a terrible vision, but now I have awakened! But I
am not in my bed!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Be not disturbed!</q> said Serenus. <q>Behold we are
all here for thy good. Thou hast been set free from the
evil spell of a disquieted spirit that for a season hath
possessed thy members.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Oh, my terrible vision! I beseech all the gods that
I may never have another!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Loose him!</q> said Serenus. <q>His bondage is
ended!</q>
</p>

<p>
Serenus and Saulus then retired to the court of the
house, while the attendants remained to minister to his
immediate necessities, and assist him in clothing himself
with his own raiment.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold thy husband is healed!</q> said Serenus to the
matron. <q>He will appear before thee presently, clothed,
and in his right mind.</q>
</p>

<p>
She bowed herself before the twain as if they were
some strange gods in human form.
</p>

<p>
<q>O sirs! I bless you for the great favor which you
have bestowed upon this house! Henceforth we will
worship your God with all devotion! Tell me his name,
I pray thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He is the God of all the earth, the Father of all men
and spirits, whether in the flesh or out of it. In him we
abide! His strength is ours, and his breath is our life!</q>
</p>

<p>
Soon the Roman entered, calm and self-controlled as
he was wont long aforetime, and clasping his wife in his
embrace, they wept for joy.
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold these are thy saviours!</q> said the matron,
pointing to the two friends as soon as the first greetings
<pb n="474"/><anchor id="Pg474"/>were passed. <q>I declared unto them that their God shall
be our God!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, give God all the glory! Behold we are but
instruments through which his power floweth!</q> said
Serenus.
</p>

<p>
The sudden recovery of his own consciousness was so
strange that the Roman marvelled, and much explanation
was necessary to make him understand the past and what
had been wrought within him. His gratitude was without
measure, and he pressed his new-found friends to
take a reward, which was refused. After giving him a
faithful but simple statement of the New Faith, and
promising that Marcius would come and instruct him
more fully, and be his friend after their departure from
the coast, they returned to the house of their host.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of the following day the whole household
of Marcius was again gathered upon the outer porch
which overlooked the charming bay. The loving circle
of friends was to be broken the next morning. Perchance
some of them might never again view each other’s
faces in the flesh. Saulus, in the charge of Julius, the
centurion, was to depart for Rome on his way to trial,
accompanied by his friends, Luke and Aristarchus. Serenus
and Amabel at the same time were to take ship
for their home in Alexandria.
</p>

<p>
As they sat looking out upon the picturesque cliffs
and islets near and distant, which were softened by the
purple of closing day, there was an interval of deep silence,
broken only by the rhythmical plash of the waves
below. All thoughts were centred upon the coming
separation.
</p>

<pb n="475"/><anchor id="Pg475"/>

<p>
At length Marcius turned toward Saulus,—
</p>

<p>
<q>Would that it were some other Cæsar than Nero before
whose tribunal thou wert to appear! But we will
hope all things, and believe in all good. Thou art wise
and fearless, and the favor of God will abide with thee!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Whatever may come to pass, I am persuaded that all
things whatsoever will work together for good!</q> replied
Saulus. <q>We are ministers of the New Faith, and look
to that, and not to ourselves.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea, brother Saulus, the paths of duty and privilege
are one and the same,</q> said Serenus.
</p>

<p>
<q>Thinkest thou that the God of all the earth will
always protect his own, O Serenus?</q> said Rebecca.
</p>

<p>
<q>All divine laws that pertain to his children are beneficent;
but if thou hast in mind only bodily protection,
it may not always be assured, although everything worketh
toward that end. But, as thou knowest well, even if
the body be destroyed it doth not harm the real man.
While we should strive to care well for our bodily manifestation,
because it is useful, its loss may be likened to
the ruin of a house, with its owner unharmed, and a more
fitting habitation awaiting him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>As thy departure draweth near, I would fain make
inquiry concerning a matter of doctrine, that I may have
a fuller understanding,</q> said Marcius. <q>I have heard
it said by some that the Messias is again to come in
visible form, and that the end of all things draweth nigh.
What thinkest thou of this?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Behold,</q> said Serenus, <q>the end of the world only
signifieth the closing of the old Dispensation, whether
in the world or in each human soul. The Messias is
<pb n="476"/><anchor id="Pg476"/>all the time making his advent invisibly in the souls of
men, and so far as his coming is perfected, it hath outward
expression, though not fully complete in them as
it was in the Nazarene. But every man already hath the
unspoken Christ, who seeketh fuller and visible articulation.
The light is within, waiting for a refinement of
the outer nature in order that it may shine through.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>There also appear to be certain differences of belief
among our brethren, concerning the birth, death, and resurrection
of Jesus!</q> said Marcius.
</p>

<p>
<q>While these are well in the literal and outward sense,
their importance is contained in the changes which they
symbolize in the inner nature of man. A belief of the
head in the sacrifice of the Prophet of Nazareth availeth
naught; the Christ mind and life must be born in the
soul.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>How dost thou view the day of judgment?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Judgment is set up within man, and is continuous.
The divine Image, or Truth, is a tribunal in every one,
and until the personal and outer life cometh into full
conformity, judgment is never ended. No outward legality,
sacrifice, or ceremony can satisfy, but only an
inner conformity to the Model.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>What is the life beyond? and is there a spiritual
body?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>The spiritual body is already formed within the
visible organism. Its quality is made by the thoughts
and intents of the heart. So far as these are discordant
with the pattern of the divine Image, there must still be
cleansing and purification in the beyond. Such a discipline
to the old man, or fleshly self, seems like a
con<pb n="477"/><anchor id="Pg477"/>suming fire, and brings severe growing-pains to the lower
consciousness.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, dear friends,</q> continued Serenus, <q>why address
all these questions concerning the deep things of the
Spirit to me? Let Saulus speak of them, and we will
listen to him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Friends,</q> said Saulus with warm earnestness, as he
grasped the hand of Serenus, <q>I have not the abundance
of wisdom necessary to teach my brother from
whom I have learned from the beginning! To Serenus
I am beholden for all that I am and have! Long ago he
saved my life in Jerusalem, when he knew that I was his
worst enemy. Not his correct doctrine only, but his
beautiful life, pricked me to the heart, and stirred my
soul to its depths, and at last kindled the flame of the
New Faith within me. His example was ever my inspiration;
and the Spirit of Truth within, which to me is
the final authority, hath confirmed to me the substance
of all his teaching. Blessed be the day, when as his
earnest but mistaken opponent in the academy of Gamaliel,
I first beheld his goodly face!</q>
</p>

<p>
The spontaneous and eloquent testimony of Saulus
touched a tender chord in every heart. Marcius was
deeply affected, and pressed forward and took the other
hand of the beloved disciple.
</p>

<p>
<q>Dear Serenus! to thee I also am beholden for everything!
I beg thee to receive my testimony and blessing.
Stained in my early years with the vice and sensuality of
the Tarsian metropolis, I was at length renewed by the
New Faith, which thou awakened within me. It not
only transformed my life, but brought to me the dearest
<pb n="478"/><anchor id="Pg478"/>and purest wife that ever fell to the lot of man. I am
minded that thou cravest no praise, but am deeply moved
to speak the simple truth!</q>
</p>

<p>
Then Rebecca, whose face shone with joy, essayed to
speak.
</p>

<p>
Serenus beckoned for silence, but the current which
had broken forth was not to be stayed.
</p>

<p>
<q>The birth of the New Faith in my soul began with
the converse I had with thee after thou hadst saved
my life on the day of the Temple panic! Thy life,
while I dwelt in the Holy City, and at Tarsus also, was
my unfailing example and inspiration!</q>
</p>

<p>
What was left for Amabel?
</p>

<p>
She stepped forward, and grasping her husband in a
warm embrace, wept great tears of joy. Words could
not be found, but silence was more eloquent.
</p>

<milestone unit="tb" rend="stars: 10"/>

<p>
<q>Friends!</q> said Serenus calmly, <q>joy and love fill my
heart to overflowing. Your words stir the depths of my
soul. But behold I have been but an unconstrained
fountain, through which hath poured forth a small measure
of the Ocean of Life and Love which hath pressed
in upon my soul.</q>

<head>CHAPTER XXXVIII<lb/>AWAITING TRIAL BEFORE NERO</head>

<p>
It was a little past mid-day, after a toilsome journey,
that Julius, with his notable prisoner, accompanied by
Luke, Aristarchus, and a few soldiers, approached the
city of the Cæsars. From the summit of a rise in the
Appian Way, a few miles distant, Saulus had the first
view of the place of his fateful residence. The long
wall of blue Sabine mountains, with Soracte in the distance,
enclosed the broad Campagna, which stretched
across to the sea and around the base of the Alban
hills. The great city seemed blended in one indiscriminate
mass of color, in which were mingled every
grade and variety of human domiciles, with colossal
baths, temples, theatres, colonnades, and palaces, relieved
by the gilded domes and roofs which flashed forth
the brightness of the warm afternoon sun. As they approached
the emporium, the great thoroughfare became
more confusing and thronged. It seemed like a mighty,
swift-flowing river with counter currents. Chariots,
richly carved and gilded, drawn by three or four horses
abreast, two and four wheeled vehicles of all qualities,
luxurious litters, inlaid with mother of pearl, carried
upon the shoulders of slaves, whose proud occupants
looked down upon pedestrians, horsemen, and footmen
<pb n="482"/><anchor id="Pg482"/>of all nationalities, soldiers and civilians, patricians
and beggars, formed a dense and endless moving panorama.
It was the pulsation of the main artery near the
heart of the world. On either side were countless tombs,
architecturally beautiful, containing numerous bas-reliefs
and inscriptions, including those of the Scipios,
Cæcilia Metella, and others of notable fame, with endless
statues, columns, and other stately memorials.
</p>

<lg>
<l>“What conflux issuing forth or passing in;</l>
<l>Prætors, Proconsuls to their provinces</l>
<l>Hasting, or on return, in robes of state,</l>
<l>Lictors and rods, the ensigns of their power,</l>
<l>Legions and cohorts, turms of horse and wings,</l>
<l>Or embassies from regions far remote,</l>
<l>In various habits, on the Appian road ...</l>
<l>Dusk faces with white silken turbans wreathed.”</l>
</lg>

<p>
Many an eye glanced with disdainful curiosity upon
the chained Saulus and his little knot of Jewish sympathizers,
as they threaded their way among the crowd
with an escort of soldiers. At length in the distance
they catch sight of the imperial palaces on the Palatine
Hill, and still beyond, crowning the summit of Capitolinus,
the Capitol, or Tabularium. Soon they pass by the
fountain of Egeria, thence by the pyramid of C. Cestius,
under the arch of Drusus, and through the Capenian
gate. Turning abruptly to the right at the Circus Maximus,
their route is lined with temples, triumphal arches,
baths, and statues, until they finally reach the barracks
of the Prætorian guard, which was always kept close at
hand for the immediate service of Cæsar.
</p>

<p>
Saulus, by his own appeal, was now at the seat of
<pb n="483"/><anchor id="Pg483"/>the governmental and military power of the earth. Even
though coming as a prisoner, a long dream of his life
was now accomplished. He was in Rome.
</p>

<p>
Julius left his prisoner with the guard at the entrance
to the barracks, and made his way to the office of Africanus
Burrus, the Prætorian Præfect, to announce the termination
of his long and successful commission. After the
usual military salute, the centurion began his report,—
</p>

<p>
<q>O Præfect! I come to make known my return from
Cæsarea with the prisoner Saulus, in charge of whom I
was sent, and now he is here, ready to be delivered into
thy keeping.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>It is well! I commend thee that thine arduous service
hath been accomplished. But so long a time hath
passed since I was informed concerning this case that
I have forgotten about the nature of the charge. I must
consult the records.</q>
</p>

<p>
While the scribe of the Præfect was searching the
docket, Julius continued his verbal report,—
</p>

<p>
<q>The man is a Jew, but hath the rights of Roman
citizenship. After being tried by Agrippa, he appealed
unto Cæsar.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Ah, yes! I now call him to mind. He is the one
who stirred up such a commotion among the Jews at
Jerusalem and Cæsarea. He was charged with preaching
a strange faith, and worshipping some unknown
god. Was he also answerable for speaking against the
authority of Cæsar?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Nay; his political loyalty was unquestioned! His
only real offence was some violation of Judaism. There
was a great clamor among the Jews for his punishment,
<pb n="484"/><anchor id="Pg484"/>and even death. Their national religion appears to be
peculiarly bigoted and intolerant. I am minded that
King Agrippa found no real fault in him. I heard that
it was declared both by Festus and Agrippa that the
man had done nothing worthy of death or even bonds,
and that he might have been set free had he not appealed
to Cæsar. Feeling the injustice of the accusations
which came from his own countrymen, he nobly
sought the highest tribunal.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>He must be an uncommon prisoner, and I shall accord
him special privileges!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I rejoice in that! Though a chained prisoner, he
is the wisest and most marvellous man that I have ever
known. He is gifted with more knowledge, even about
sailing a ship, than the master with whom we took passage.
Had his advice been followed, we should have
been spared a shipwreck, and even then, but for his
wisdom and wonderful encouragement, I am persuaded
that all on board would have perished.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>May the gods be merciful to him! Thine experience
proves that a prisoner may sometimes be a philosopher,</q>
said the Præfect thoughtfully; <q>but how
unfortunate that a man of such superior wisdom should
be a devotee of a strange and superstitious religion!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Yea! He pays homage to a countryman of his own—a
Nazarene whose name was Jesus—whom he calls <q>the
Christ.</q> He teaches that this Christ was a God-man,
and therefore a leader and ruler; but that his kingdom
is in the souls of men, and that it hath no dishonor
for the government of Cæsar.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Shade of Apollo! that is a strange kind of an
em<pb n="485"/><anchor id="Pg485"/>pire! Even our Roman gods have but feeble power to
change the feelings and conduct of men. But it would
seem that much learning hath made the man strange,
and perchance a little beside himself!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>So I thought at first sight, most excellent Præfect!
but his life, virtue, and power are marvellous. He hath
ability, through his God, to heal the sick and cast out
foul spirits, and both at Melita and Puteoli he did
many wonderful works. The inhabitants were unwilling
to part with him.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Our soothsayers essay to perform miracles, but I
have in no wise confidence in their pretension. But
your report hath made me much interested in your notable
prisoner. I shall give him as large a liberty as
my duty will allow.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I assure thee that he in no wise will abuse it,</q>
said the centurion with enthusiasm. <q>Behold his presence,
though not at first outwardly prepossessing, is very
attractive and helpful! I cannot describe it, but he is
unlike any other man I ever knew. I feel strangely
loath to part with him. But my duty is ended, and I
have only to deliver him into thy hands.</q>
</p>

<p>
Julius then handed to Burrus the sealed parchments
that were sent by Festus and King Agrippa. The Præfect
broke the seals, and carefully read the contents.
</p>

<p>
<q>I perceive that this is an unwonted and prejudiced
case from the beginning. The charges are made wholly
by the Jews, who accuse the man of sedition and blasphemy.
But there is no evidence here. Did any witnesses
come with thee?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>None, O Præfect! but I was informed that some were
<pb n="486"/><anchor id="Pg486"/>to follow. It hath been made known to me that a vessel
which sailed from Cæsarea soon after ours was lost
in the same terrible storm in which we were shipwrecked.
Peradventure some of the accusers of Saulus were aboard
of her.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That may cause delay in the trial. But what dost
thou think of the charges?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>That they are false, and have no basis other than
in the prejudice of that peculiar people, the Jews. Notwithstanding
his strange faith, which we cannot rightly
understand, he is a man whom gods and men must
reverence, yea, even love.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I would look upon the face of this unwonted Jew,</q>
said Burrus. <q>Bring him in!</q>
</p>

<p>
The centurion left and soon returned, conducting his
prisoner into the presence of the Præfect. Saulus
showed signs of his many hardships, and his face looked
like one whose life had been exposed to many strains
and shocks. His hair was gray, his brow furrowed, and
his cheeks hollow, but his eyes were bright and piercing.
While unattractive in form and feature, there was an
indescribable light and vigor within, which seemed to
shine through the flesh, and impress and attract the most
careless beholder.
</p>

<p>
<q>This is thy prisoner, O Præfect, Saulus of Tarsus!</q>
said Julius.
</p>

<p>
Saulus gave the Præfect a proper greeting.
</p>

<p>
<q>The report of the centurion to which I have listened
giveth me great respect for thee. Thy captivity shall be
made as easy as my service to Cæsar will allow, and
when opportunity offers I shall be pleased to have some
<pb n="487"/><anchor id="Pg487"/>converse with thee. But now, after thy long journey,
thou dost need rest and refreshment, so for the present
I will send thee to thy quarters.</q>
</p>

<p>
Saulus thanked the Præfect for his kindly words.
</p>

<p>
A Prætorian was directed to take him to a comfortable
outer room in the best part of the prisoners’ quarters, and
the order was given that he be allowed to hire a house
in the vicinity for himself, if he so desired, until the
time of his trial.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the Tiber, in a district mostly squalid and
miserable, there had grown up a large community of
Jews. It was the residential section of the rabble, and
headquarters for the most ignoble trades and poorest
merchandise. Although low and thoroughly despised by
the Romans, but a small portion of the Hebrews were
slaves. At this time toleration was general, and both
they and the Christians enjoyed immunity from disturbance
in their synagogue services.
</p>

<p>
As ever before and since, the Jewish element was distinct
and unamalgamated. Through all the ages they
have been a standing wonder,—a <q>peculiar people.</q>
</p>

<p>
As soon as Saulus was settled in Rome, in order that
his countrymen might not misunderstand his position, he
lost no time in inviting their principal men—the rulers
and elders of the synagogues—to meet him, so that
he might disabuse them of prejudice, which many of
them already had concerning him. They were sharply
divided into parties and sects. There were Jews of the
old order, who were hostile to Christianity; Judaizing
Christians, or such as nominally accepted the Prophet
of Nazareth, but clung to ceremonialism; and a few
con<pb n="488"/><anchor id="Pg488"/>verts to the New Faith, who nearly or quite disregarded
the traditional code. With such incongruous elements
Saulus began his labors, striving upon the basis of essential
truth to harmonize their discords and make peace.
</p>

<p>
At the time appointed, which was only three days
after his arrival, the room of Saulus was crowded with
the principal representatives of the various sects which
he had invited to meet him. While intending to preach
the gospel both to Jew and Gentile, he was minded to
begin by an effort to conciliate the feelings of his Hebrew
brethren both toward himself and the New Faith.
He came at once to the point, as soon as his auditors
were convened, and began his address.
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Brethren and friends! I would make known unto
you that I am no traitor to our nation because I have
appealed to the Roman power. It hath been rumored
among you that I have come to Rome as an accuser of
the Sanhedrin before Cæsar. But instead, I have come
to defend myself against its enmity. The chief priests
and elders invoked the lower tribunals of the foreign
power, and thus compelled me to appeal to the supreme
authority for justice and vindication. I have committed
no offence against Israel, or the customs of our fathers,
yet my countrymen delivered me up with accusations of
sedition and blasphemy.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Behold I am one of your brethren—of the seed of
Abraham—of the tribe of Benjamin—a Hebrew of the
Hebrews, and my labors have been abundant for the
salvation of our people! Even the Roman governor was
ready to set me free, but my Jewish enemies would none
of it.</q>
</p>

<pb n="489"/><anchor id="Pg489"/>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">I call God to witness that my only crime hath been
my firm faith in the deliverance of his people through
the Messiah, foretold and promised by the prophets of
old. I am set for the defence of the gospel, not by envy
and strife, but through love and good-will, that it may
abound unto all nations and to you-ward. Behold the
covenant which the God of glory made with our father
Abraham, and the testimony to Moses while in the
wilderness to raise up a Prophet unto us, and the Holy
One spoken of by Isaiah, all are fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth!
As foretold, he was put to death, and opened
not his mouth against his enemies. I beseech you, do
not vainly continue to look for a warlike Messiah, who,
through garments rolled in blood, shall restore only a
seen kingdom, whereby the things of this world prevail!
Behold in due season a spiritual dominion cometh
which shall fill the whole earth! Carnal weapons must
give place to the sword of the Spirit, until all nations
shall be brought under the mild sway of the Prince of
Peace. The Prophet of Nazareth laid the foundation
for an Universal Kingdom, but its coming will be without
observation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>I might persuade you by arguments without end,
drawn from your own Scriptures, of the truth of the
spiritual faith which I proclaim! I could fill your ears
with the warnings, promises, and inspirations of the
ancient patriarchs, law-givers, singers, and prophets that
have arisen among our own people. I beseech you,
therefore, to lay aside every prejudice, and no longer
dwell in dead forms and ceremonies. I would that ye
be transformed by the renewing of your minds through
<pb n="490"/><anchor id="Pg490"/>the power of the Holy Ghost. I beseech you to give
heed unto the words I have spoken, and declare unto
you that it is for the hope of Israel that I am bound
with this chain!</q>
</p>

<p>
Instead of bringing peace, the earnest appeal of Saulus
increased the dissensions among his auditors.
</p>

<p>
It was ever thus. Truth, when launched into the
midst of error and prejudice, unfailingly stirs them up,
and brings their bitter dregs to the surface. There is
far more hope of winning an honest sceptic than a self-satisfied
bigot. The Gentiles, or heathen, finally proved
much more accessible to the New Faith than the Chosen
People themselves, although the number of Hebrew
Christians somewhat increased.
</p>

<p>
After a heated discussion, the larger part of the audience
withdrew, and a formal separation took place
between them and the <q>Apostle to the Gentiles.</q>
</p>

<p>
During the two years that the trial of Saulus, for
various reasons, was delayed, he remained in his own
hired house, and was permitted much liberty in proclaiming
the power of the gospel to all who came to
him. He also wrote important letters to the churches
of the East. But he was still a prisoner, chained by
the arm, both night and day, to a Prætorian. Many of
the rough soldiers who guarded him were moulded by
his influence, and thoroughly transformed in life and
character by the spiritual righteousness which he awakened
within them. Even some of the household of
Cæsar and a few patricians were touched to the heart
by the halo of the divinity which shone out through the
personality of the great Apostle.
</p>

<pb n="491"/><anchor id="Pg491"/>

<p>
As fair white lilies sometimes shoot up from the foul
black slime at the bottom of a pond so that their fragrance
is wafted abroad by the breezes of heaven, so
the seed of a spiritual tree was scattered in the great
seething morass of corruption on the banks of the Tiber,
which would yet spring up and overspread the nations
with its branches.

<p>
<q>Present Saulus of Tarsus for arraignment!</q>
</p>

<p>
Immediately after these words fell from the lips of
Nero, the notable prisoner was led into the basilica
of the imperial palace.
</p>

<p>
The room, of magnificent grandeur, was of great size
and perfect proportion. The pavement, in mosaic designs
of wonderful pattern and finish, was a masterpiece
of skill, in which serpentine, onyx, and porphyry
were artistically blended. A long row of lofty white
marble columns, containing zones of blended pale green,
stretched down the length of the hall on either side, and
the walls were inlaid with giallo antico, lapis lazuli,
and other fine marbles of variegated shades, which came
from the mountains near Pisa. The broad cornices of
alabaster were covered with a wealth of mythological
figures carved in strange and grotesque design. The
arched roof, of imposing height and of a deep blue
shade, was so studded with golden points as to represent
the evening heavens. The outer spaces beyond the
columns were filled with statues in bronze, silver, gold,
ivory, alabaster, and marbles, many of which were the
fruits of despoliation in various cities of the East.
Mingled with the statues were rare flowers in graven or
<pb n="493"/><anchor id="Pg493"/>embossed silver vases which stood upon veined tables
of citron.
</p>

<p>
Nero’s gold and ivory chair, in which he half reclined,
was at the centre of the apse, which projected from the
eastern end of the basilica. Broad, polished steps of
porphyry, with a white marble balustrade on each side,
led up to the seat of the imperial judge. A little to
his right, in a place of special honor, an ivory cabinet,
inlaid with mother of pearl, contained his poems,
tragedies, and orations, which he counted of priceless
value to the world; and near by hung his golden harp,
adorned with precious stones, upon which, in the <foreign rend="italic">rôle</foreign>
of a <q>divine artist,</q> he played to special audiences.
</p>

<p>
Ranged in a double row below him on either side
stood his special guard of Prætorians, whose silver
eagles and gilded uniforms gave glitter and pomp to
every official sitting, whether important or otherwise.
Clustered a short distance behind him stood a group
of tall lictors, whose shining axed fasces symbolized
a power which none on earth could dispute.
</p>

<p>
Saulus was placed at a little distance in front of
Nero, upon a spot marked by a different color in the
pavement, and known as the prisoners’ circle. His
chain was upon him, and there was no friend by his
side.
</p>

<p>
To the right and left, on raised seats, and nearly in
front of the imperial chair, was the council of Assessors,
twenty in number, who were all men of high rank.
Among them were the two consuls and the selected
representatives of other magistracies of Rome, while the
remainder consisted of senators, chosen by lot.
</p>

<pb n="494"/><anchor id="Pg494"/>

<p>
As Saulus took his place, Nero looked down languidly,
as if impatient at such an interruption in the
work of revising a new tragedy, in which he had great
pride. He wore a white tunic and a toga of rare purple,
and upon his head a laurel wreath. His eyes were
dull and bloodshot, and his low, flat head, square jaw,
flabby double chin, and thick neck combined to give
him an unmistakable canine cast of countenance. His
fat white hands looked waxy from constant bathing and
polishing, which was submitted to in order that their
suppleness might be improved for harp-playing. Mingled
plainly in his face were colossal vanity, cruelty,
suffering, and silliness. He was not naturally a fool,
but his talent had become strangely abnormal. Though
yet young in years, they had been long enough to transform
a man into a monster. He blinked as he turned
his head from side to side, as if the air were thick with
bloody spectres that he could not avoid, and from whom
he expected an assault. Disordered in mind and body,
he was distracted by physical pains and psychical hallucinations.
Guilt had honeycombed him, and in a
tragic manner he often told his intimates that he was
haunted by all the Furies. But though a profligate and
buffoon, he was lord of all the Roman legions, and
through them the world was at his feet.
</p>

<p>
Saulus before Nero!
</p>

<p>
World-wide contrasts in the same picture!
</p>

<p>
Blackness and high light in juxtaposition!
</p>

<p>
Not merely opposite personalities, but two irreconcilable
kingdoms—even worlds—confronting each other!
</p>

<p>
Hatred, love—resistance, non-resistance—vice,
vir<pb n="495"/><anchor id="Pg495"/>tue—legions, moral ideals—animalism, spirituality!
These, rarely in the world’s history so sharply defined
between persons, but ever in warfare in human souls!
</p>

<p>
Nero called upon one of his consuls to read the indictment.
It was briefly summed up in three charges.
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">First, the prisoner, Saulus, is accused of disturbing
the Jews in the free exercise of their worship, which is
secured to them by Roman law.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Second, he is charged with desecrating their Temple.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Third, it is claimed that he violated the public peace
by seditious agitation, as the leader of a factious sect
which is treasonable to the authority of Rome.</q>
</p>

<p>
Saulus was asked to enter a plea concerning the indictment.
</p>

<p>
<q>I stand before the tribunal of Cæsar, and answer
<hi rend="italic">not guilty</hi>!</q> said he in a calm but firm voice.
</p>

<p>
Nero looked down contemptuously upon the prisoner,
and took but a sluggish interest in the charges. He
showed plainly by his manner that the whole affair was
too trivial to be worthy of more than a passing notice.
Of the Jewish religion he knew little and cared less.
The idea that this poor fanatic, with no armed following,
was a menace to the peace of the Empire was preposterous.
Nevertheless, he must keep up the forms of justice,
and the trial proceeded.
</p>

<p>
The witnesses who had come from Cæsarea were examined,
and the papers in the case, which had been sent
by Agrippa, read by the consul. It was plain to every
one that the evidence was partial, and even contradictory.
After the prosecution had been fully heard, Nero
again cast his eyes indifferently upon Saulus.
</p>

<pb n="496"/><anchor id="Pg496"/>

<p>
<q>Hast thou any one to speak in thy defence?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>With the consent of Cæsar, I would be heard briefly
in my own behalf!</q> replied Saulus.
</p>

<p>
While the Apostle could but recoil from the character
and personality of his judge, he was the man to respect
the dignity which belonged to an exalted office.
He began his reply in a manner courteous, calm, and
respectful. Years of discipline had softened his native
impetuosity, and given him thorough poise and self-command.
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">I appear before this supreme tribunal, O Imperator,
with assurance that I shall find complete justice at thy
hands. As the fountain of government and power in
this, the greatest Empire the world hath seen, I am persuaded
that thou mayest look with indifference upon the
small jealousies of Judean sectarianism. I might confidently
rest my case before thee almost wholly upon
the discordant and even contradictory testimony of my
accusers. I call thee to witness, O Cæsar, that King
Agrippa, who hath much knowledge of the religion of
our nation, found me guiltless of the charges for which
I am called to make answer! Behold the whole matter
is but an opinion or interpretation between Jewish sects,
concerning which the imperial government hath no concern!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Regarding the first accusation, I have called in
question the liberty of no man concerning the exercise
of his religious faith. I went up to Jerusalem to take
alms to the poor, and to preach a pure faith, but neither
in the Temple, nor in the synagogue, nor the street, did
I dispute with any man, nor in any manner disturb
<pb n="497"/><anchor id="Pg497"/>the peace! It is indeed true that I belong to the Nazarenes,
which the scribes and elders call a heretical sect,
but of a truth, we worship the God of our fathers. We
accept the things which are written in the law and the
prophets when truly interpreted, and peradventure it
be allowable to have sects of Pharisees and Sadducees
among the Jews, there is nothing more illegal in the
existence of the Nazarenes. Behold it is but a question
of religious liberty, which Rome, to her honor, guarantees
to all her subjects. I have in all this controversy a
conscience void of offence toward God and man!</q>
</p>

<p>
Nero moved uneasily, but made no interruption.
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">The second accusation, alleging the profanation of
the Temple, hath no foundation. Behold my visit was
only in discharge of sacred duty, and I made no tumult
with any man! Such a strange charge hath not been
proven, and cometh only from the prejudice of the Sadducees.
I have always held honor toward the Temple
of our fathers, and in no way profaned its courts or
ordinances.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">Concerning the arraignment of stirring up sedition,
it is utterly vain and empty! I have honored the Roman
law, and taught that the powers that be are ordained
of God. I ask that you hold in remembrance that they
who have complained against me are all Jews, and that
no Roman in all Judea, who is set by the authority of
Cæsar, hath said aught for my condemnation.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="post: none">I would not weary thee by pointing out the subtlety
of the differences between the Jewish sects, for much of
it would seem to be foolishness to any Roman; but, O
Imperator, I may truly avow that the Nazarenes live a
<pb n="498"/><anchor id="Pg498"/>New Faith which hath priceless value for all men! It
is a spiritual kingdom which is set up within them, and
hath no controversy with the material kingdoms of this
world. So long as religious liberty is proclaimed by
Rome, the Nazarenes never will be found disloyal!</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, O Cæsar! I cannot close my appeal without
saying that <hi rend="italic">I feel a love in my heart for thee, and would
that the most excellent faith of the Nazarenes might light up
thy soul!</hi></q>
</p>

<p>
A look of strange surprise at the audacity of Saulus
passed like a flash over the faces of the spectators, and
all eyes were turned toward Nero to see its effect upon
him. But the outburst of the Apostle had been so evidently
spontaneous and sincere that Cæsar was momentarily
touched. His flabby features turned paler and
more constrained than was wont, and moisture appeared
in his heavy eyes as they were staringly fastened upon
his prisoner. Instead of resentment, he seemed fascinated
by so strange a human phenomenon.
</p>

<p>
<q>I have earnest good-will toward thee, O Imperator,
and warmly commend the New Faith for the health of
thy soul! I beseech thee to bring forth the works of
righteousness, temperance, and mercy! Thy Jewish
prisoner wishes thee well, and whatever befall him, he
hopeth and prayeth for thy salvation!</q>
</p>

<p>
The auditors were yet more astounded, and expected
to see Nero fly into a rage at the closing words of Saulus.
</p>

<p>
The tables were turned, and behold the great Apostle
was in the judgment-seat, and Cæsar the prisoner!
</p>

<p>
But there was only gentleness in the tones of Saulus,
and the earnest love of man for his fellow-man shone
<pb n="499"/><anchor id="Pg499"/>out so clearly that it could not be mistaken. Such a
warm spiritual brightness lighted up his features that
the Lion of Rome was both awed and softened.
</p>

<p>
The trial closed with hasty formality. The Assessors
by a large majority voted for acquittal, and Nero confirmed
the verdict, and the chains of Saulus were stricken
off.

<p>
Again Saulus was face to face with Nero. Since his
first acquittal the Apostle had made long and important
missionary journeys, laboring earnestly for the spread of
the New Faith. But at length, upon the testimony of
informers, he was arrested by the magistrates of Nicopolis,
and again sent to Rome for trial before Cæsar.
</p>

<p>
Great events had taken place in the world’s metropolis
since the former trial. A conflagration—probably instigated
by Nero—had destroyed nearly half the city,
and the Christians were charged with the wholesale
incendiarism. Their number was now considerable, and
they had become recognized as a peculiar sect, distinct
from the Jews, and were popularly counted as grossly
superstitious and disloyal. Bitterness and persecution
were meted out to them.
</p>

<p>
Instead of living in his own hired house, as aforetime,
Saulus was incarcerated in the dungeon of the
Mamertine prison, and his friends were denied the privilege
of visiting him. But his indomitable spirit rose
above all outward things, and his last letter, written to
<pb n="501"/><anchor id="Pg501"/>Timotheus while on the verge of the Unseen, is full
of triumph. Pessimism, doubt, and fear had no place
in his soul. There was no such thing as defeat.
</p>

<p>
With perfect confidence in the inherent power of
Truth, and its final supremacy, he was aware that its
progress was not dependent upon the bodily continuance
of himself or any other person.
</p>

<p>
During his final hours in the seen form he was calm
and joyful. Even the sleep of his last night on the
rock floor of his dungeon was sweet and refreshing.
</p>

<p>
The final scene, which took place in the early morning,
was secret and sudden. Saulus, with the few who
had him in charge, passed out upon the Appian Way,
through the gate, which after nineteen hundred years
is yet called by his name, by the pyramid of C. Cestius,
and on about three miles, to a green and level spot
known as Aquæ Salviæ, where they halted.
</p>

<p>
The face of the martyr already shone with a heavenly
light! He had ascended a Mount of Transfiguration,
and his inner vision was opened! The realm of physical
sensation and suffering was left behind, and now
he looks out and up, and behold the whole Invisible
is visible! He has already landed upon the Delectable
Shore! Here is a new and real Universe!
</p>

<p>
Hands are clasped with those who had passed before!
</p>

<p>
A warm unison of love thrills through reunited souls!
</p>

<p>
Things that seemed lost are found!
</p>

<p>
Stephanos was by his side, and gave him love and
cheer!
</p>

<p>
What new spiritual activities and delightful ministries
of loving service!
